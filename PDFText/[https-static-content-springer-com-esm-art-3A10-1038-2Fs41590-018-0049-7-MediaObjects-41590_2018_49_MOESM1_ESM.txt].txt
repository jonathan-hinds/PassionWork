Raw distributions of the 166 immunophenotypes studied in the Milieu Intérieur cohort 
Distributions are shown before outlier removal, imputation, batch correction and transformation to normality. Transformed 
distributions are shown in Supplementary Figure 15.

Repeatability of semi-automated flow cytometry measurements 
Repeatability of (a) absolute cell counts and (b) MFI estimated based on measurements performed at five different time points over 
five months on the same five individuals. Points represent the average of measurements across replicates of the same individual, and 
bars 3 times their standard deviation.

Reproducibility of semi-automated flow cytometry measurements 
Comparison of cell counts measured in different flow cytometry panels across the 1,000 Milieu Intérieur donors. Spearman’s ρ 
correlation coefficients are shown. 
 
 
 
Supplementary Figure 14 
Batch effects on measured immunophenotypes 
(a) Effect of the sampling hour on the absolute number of CD16hi NK cells. Whole blood samples were collected from the 1,000 
Milieu Intérieur healthy subjects every working day from 8 to 11AM. The sampling hour has a significant effect on different immune 
cell counts, such as the absolute number of CD16hi NK cells, which were adjusted for this batch effect. (b) Effect of the sampling day 
on immunophenotypes measured in the Milieu Intérieur cohort. Whole blood samples were collected from the 1,000 Milieu Intérieur 
healthy subjects every working day from September 2012 to august 2013. Variation in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 
several protein markers was observed along the sampling period. All MFIs were corrected for this batch effect using the ComBat non-
parametric Bayesian framework. Three examples of uncorrected (left column) and corrected (right columns) values are shown.

Correlations among circulating levels of immune cell populations in the Milieu Intérieur cohort 
Sample correlations were estimated between the residuals of the log-transformed immunophenotypes from a regression model that 
included non-genetic covariates selected with the stability selection algorithm (described below) on the 39 non-genetic covariates, 
together with the batch variables. Correlations between -0.3 and 0.3 were set to 0, to improve readability.

Age, sex and CMV infection impact protein levels of immune cell markers in 1,000 healthy individuals 
Significant multiplicative effects of (a) increasing age, (b) female sex and (c) CMV seropositivity on the mean fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) of protein markers of immune cells of 1,000 healthy individuals, controlling for the two other factors, batch effects and 
genome-wide significant SNPs The multiplicative effect sizes were estimated in a linear mixed model with a log-transformed response 
variable, controlling for batch effects and genome-wide significant SNPs, and then transformed to the original data scale. The 99% 
confidence intervals (99%CIs) were false coverage-adjusted, considering that only 99%CIs of effect sizes with a significant test 
(adjusted P<0.01) are shown. Adaptive and innate immune cells are represented in grey and black, respectively. These analyses were 
performed with the mmi R package (Online Methods).
