Sephardics, and Recent Russian Immigrants

Background: Jews have lower rates of alcohol-related problems than other Caucasians. The ADH2*2
allele of the alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) gene protects against alcoholism in Asians and is found in
approximately 20% of Jews. We studied the relationship of ADH2*2 to DSM-IV dependence severity in a
random community sample of Israeli Ashkenazis, recent Russian immigrants (also Ashkenazis), and
Sephardics.
Methods: Subjects participated in a structured interview that included highly reliable questions on
DSM-IV alcohol dependence symptoms. ADH2 genotype was determined for 68 subjects.
Results: Recent Russian immigrants had more past and lifetime DSM-IV dependence symptoms.
Sephardics had a higher prevalence of ADH2*2 than Ashkenazis. Controlling for group and other poten-
tially confounding factors, ADH2*2 was associated with a lower lifetime DSM-IV alcohol dependence
severity, although this differed somewhat within groups.
Conclusions: ADH2*2 protects against dependence severity in Jewish samples. Future work in larger
samples should address genetic and environmental factors that affect the relationship of ADH2*2 to alcohol
consumption and dependence.
Key Words: ADH2, Alcohol, Alcohol Dependence, Jews, Genetic.
BOTH GENETIC AND environmental factors influ-ence the occurrence of alcoholism. Jewish individuals
generally drink less and have lower rates of alcohol-use
disorders than other Caucasians (Levav et al., 1997; Yeung
and Greenwald, 1992). Older social explanations of the
lower rates that are based on religious practices (Bales,
1962; Snyder, 1958) are no longer accepted (Flasher and
Maisto, 1984). Furthermore, empirical data (Hasin and
Kohn, unpublished data, 2002) from the Epidemiologic
Catchment Area study (Regier et al., 1990) show that the
level of religiosity cannot explain the low level of alcohol
problems in Jews compared with other groups. None of this
work addressed variability in drinking within the Jewish
population. Understanding this dimension may lead to a
better understanding of Jewish/non-Jewish differences in
drinking and of the etiology of alcoholism in general.
The importance of genetic factors in the development of
alcohol dependence has been well established (Heath et al.,
1997). The clearest evidence for specific genes influencing
this process comes from findings on alcohol-metabolizing
genes (Li, 2000). The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes
on chromosome 4 are involved in alcohol metabolism
(Edenberg, 2000; Li, 2000). ADH2, found largely in the
liver, converts ethanol to acetaldehyde. Polymorphisms in
the ADH2 gene result in isozymes that have very different
catalytic properties. A protective relationship has been
found between ADH2*2 and alcoholism in Asians and Cau-
casians (Li, 2000; Whitfield, 1997). In most European pop-
ulations, ADH2*2 is rare (Goedde et al., 1992), but it is still
generally protective against alcoholism and heavy drinking
(Borras et al., 2000; Whitfield et al., 1998).
Recently, reports have shown a relatively high prevalence
of ADH2*2 in Jewish samples (Carr et al., 2002; Neumark
et al., 1998; Shea et al., 2001), suggesting that ADH2*2
might explain the low rates of alcoholism in this group. The
relationship of ADH2*2 to drinking in Jews was first stud-
ied in two independent Israeli samples: community resi-
dents and treated heroin addicts. In these samples of men,
ADH2*2 was associated with very infrequent drinking and
lower peak alcohol consumption levels (Neumark et al.,
1998). However, alcohol dependence was not measured in
this study. Among Jewish college volunteers and adults in

the Midwestern US (Carr et al., 2002), ADH2*2 was pro-
tective against frequent consumption in male adults. Al-
though not protective against frequent consumption in
college-age men, ADH2*2 was associated with unpleasant
reactions to drinking in both male college students and
adults. Alcohol dependence was not measured in this study
either. In Jewish college volunteers in the Southwestern US
(Shea et al., 2001), ADH2*2 was protective against frequent
consumption in men, although it was not related to other
consumption measures or DSM-IV alcohol dependence,
which was rare. Thus, although significant relationships
between ADH2*2 and alcohol use were found in all Jewish
groups studied, the results were not consistent across all
measures. Furthermore, dependence was measured in only
one of the studies (Shea et al., 2001), in which it was rare.
Assessing dependence in categorical rather than continu-
ous form may have resulted in some loss of information.
Inconsistencies between the studies could have occurred
for several reasons, including differences in measurement
of the phenotype, other methodological differences (e.g.,
sampling or statistical analysis), or between-sample differ-
ences in other influences on alcohol. Using consistent
methods and continuous dependence measures in contrast-
ing Jewish groups seemed to offer an opportunity to better
understand the influence of ADH2*2 on the severity of
alcohol dependence in Jews.
A setting to study such groups exists in Israel. Since the
founding of Israel in 1948, large waves of immigration have
resulted in population subgroups from different areas of
the world (Dohrenwend et al., 1992; Israeli Central Bureau
of Statistics, 1999). Until the early 1990s, the two main
population subgroups were Ashkenazis (European and
Russian background) and Sephardics (Middle Eastern and
North African background). Analyses of 1995 Israeli na-
tional survey data indicated that Sephardics were less likely
than Ashkenazis to be drinkers and to have gotten drunk
recently (Aharonovich et al., 2001). Sephardics and Ash-
kenazis also differ in some genetic respects (Pollack et al.,
2000; Roitberg-Tambur et al., 1995).
A third group has emerged more recently. Since late
1989, approximately 780,000 immigrants from the former
Soviet Union (FSU) arrived in Israel, many of them arriv-
ing in the early 1990s. These immigrants now constitute
approximately 15% of Israel’s population (Israeli Central
Bureau of Statistics, 1999). Russia has one of the world’s
highest levels of alcohol consumption (Treml, 1997),
whereas Israel has one of the lowest (Verhoek, 1995). The
1995 national survey data showed that recent Russian im-
migrants were more likely to be drinkers and to become
drunk than other Israelis (Rahav et al., 1999). Further-
more, recent Russian immigrants were more likely to be
drinkers than those from earlier waves of immigration from
Russia to Israel (Hasin et al., 1998). The 1995 national data
did not include information on alcohol dependence. How-
ever, when summarized, the results indicated that Ashkena-
zis, Sephardics, and recent Russian immigrants to Israel
constituted contrasting groups in terms of drinking.
Using standardized methodology across a small community
sample of these three population subgroups, we previously
showed that ADH2*2 was associated with a lower peak life-
time alcohol consumption (Hasin et al., 2002). This relation-
ship seemed to differ by population subgroup, because within-
group exploration did not indicate decreased consumption
among Russian subjects with ADH2*2. In this study, we ad-
dressed the relationship of ADH2*2 to alcohol dependence in
the three contrasting Jewish-Israeli groups: Ashkenazis, Seph-
ardics, and recent Russian immigrants.
METHODS
Setting, Sample Design, and Procedures
The study was conducted in an Israeli city of approximately 140,000. To
balance the number of Ashkenazis, Sephardics, and recent Russian immi-
grants, subjects were sampled from three neighborhoods, each identified
(via census information) as having a high concentration of one of the
groups. Households were sampled within these three neighborhoods, and
introduction letters were sent to the households. Each household was then
called, and adult household members from age 22 to 65 years were
enumerated (individuals between the ages of 18 and 21 were unavailable
due to military service). With oversampling for men, one member from
each household was randomly chosen and invited to participate in a
personal interview. Of 103 designated households, subjects from 75 par-
ticipated (response rate, 73%). After obtaining written informed consent,
nurses or physicians conducted in-person interviews in privacy, mainly in
the subject’s home. Data verification was later conducted with a randomly
selected subset of subjects by telephone from New York. DNA for geno-
typing was obtained from 68 subjects (91% of those interviewed). ADH2
genotype (ADH2*1 and ADH2*2) was determined by enzymatic amplifi-
cation of genomic DNA followed by hybridization with allele-specific
oligonucleotides (Xu et al., 1988). ADH2*3 was not tested, because it
ordinarily occurs only in African Americans (Ehlers et al., 2001; Thomas-
son et al., 1995) and Native Americans (Wall et al., 1997).
Measures
DSM-IV alcohol dependence and abuse criteria and diagnoses were
derived from the Alcohol Use Disorders and Associated Disabilities In-
terview Schedule (AUDADIS; Grant et al., 1995). This instrument, de-
signed for lay interviewers, has been used in national and community
epidemiological research in the US (Grant, 1997; Hasin et al., 1997c). The
AUDADIS has excellent psychometric properties in US and international
samples (Canino et al., 1999; Chatterji et al., 1997; Grant et al., 1995;
Hasin et al., 1996, 1997a,b). AUDADIS items were translated into He-
brew and Russian (available on request from DH). The AUDADIS
interviewer training took 2 days and was based on procedures used in US
and international studies.
In the AUDADIS, detailed questions covered the seven symptoms used
to diagnose DSM-IV alcohol dependence in two time frames: the last 12
months (current) and prior to the last 12 months (past) (Grant et al., 1995;
Hasin et al., 1997a). Computer algorithms combined this information to
create current, past, and lifetime diagnoses of DSM-IV alcohol depen-
dence (Grant et al., 1995; Hasin et al., 1997c). In addition to the diagnosis,
a lifetime severity indicator was created from the AUDADIS dependence
items consisting of a count of DSM-IV criteria for dependence (range,
0–7). The  coefficient for the dependence severity indicator was 0.73. An
interrater reliability study of dependence severity in 23 Israeli subjects
showed excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.93).

Subjects
Due to some mixing of population subgroups within the three neigh-
borhoods, final determination of Ashkenazi, Sephardic, or recent Russian
immigrant status used self-reported origin (Flasher and Maisto, 1984).
Ashkenazi origin (n  23) included Europe, the Americas, Australia,
South Africa, or the FSU (arriving before 1989). Sephardic origin (n  25)
included those from North Africa or other Middle Eastern countries.
Recent Russian immigrants (n  27) were those who had immigrated
from the FSU since 1989. Among the Russians, 70.3% had been in Israel
longer than 5 years; only one had immigrated to Israel within the last 12
months. Of the full sample, approximately 70% of subjects were men.
Most were married and working. More Russian immigrants finished col-
lege (87%) than Ashkenazis (23%) or Sephardics (30%). Ashkenazis were
older (48.7 years; SD, 9.8) than recent Russian immigrants (42.3 years;
SD, 11.0) or Sephardics (36.3 years; SD, 10.8).
Analysis
To test differences in proportions, the 2 test was used when suitable.
When a contingency table has more than 25% of cells with small expected
values, the 2 test may not be valid. When this happened, a likelihood ratio
test (LRT) based on the log-linear model was used (Fienberg, 1985).
Group differences in count variables (e.g., number of alcohol-dependence
symptoms) with skewed distributions and heterogeneous variances across
groups were tested with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, which
does not assume a given distribution or homogeneous variance across
groups (Bickel and Doksum, 1977).
To examine the relationship of ADH2 genotype to severity of DSM-IV
dependence while controlling for population group and other variables,
the Poisson regression model (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) was used.
This model was selected due to the form of the outcome variable and its
distribution. Ordinary linear regression assumes a normal distribution and
a constant variance. Poisson regression is suitable for outcome variables
that are in count form, have an approximate Poisson distribution, are
skewed, or have variance proportional to the mean. In our case, the
outcome was in count form, the distribution was quite skewed and ap-
proximated a Poisson distribution, and the variances of the three groups
(Russian, other Ashkenazi, and Sephardic) increased with the group
means. Thus, the Poisson regression model was the preferred statistical
approach.
The regression coefficient for a binary predictor variable in a Pois-
son model is the log of the ratio of the means of the outcome (in this
case, alcohol-dependence severity) for each of the two levels of the
binary predictor. To aid in interpretation of the results, we also pre-
sented the unlogged ratios of these two means for each of the binary
predictor variables. These are interpreted similarly to an odds ratio (1.0
indicates no association, 1.0 indicates a positive association, and 
1.0 indicates an inverse relationship). In the model, the control variable
represented by age was dichotomized at 33 years because among the
Russians, this would differentiate subjects who immigrated as adults
from others who immigrated at a younger age. Including other forms of
the age variable in the model (e.g., dichotomizing at the median) did
not affect the main results.
Within-group associations between genotype and alcohol-
dependence severity were explored with the Spearman rank correlation
coefficient, which uses rank information in the two variables regardless
of their joint distribution (Bickel and Doksum, 1977). This applies to
the case of ADH2*1/*1, ADH2*1/*2, and ADH2*2/*2, considered to
indicate ascending order of the ADH2 effect. All p levels reflect
two-tailed tests.
RESULTS
Demographics and Drinking by Population Subgroup
The Russians, other Ashkenazis, and Sephardics did
not differ on gender, marital status, or employment, but
the Russians were significantly more likely to have com-
pleted college (as expected), and the Sephardics were
significantly more likely to be younger (Table 1). A high
proportion of all three groups were current or past drink-
ers, variables on which the groups did not differ. In
contrast, when heavier drinking was considered, signifi-
cant differences between the Russians and the other
groups emerged. This included ever having had five or
more drinks on an occasion, an indicator of at-risk drink-
ing in epidemiological samples (Caetano et al., 1997;
Hasin et al., 1996). The Russians were also significantly
more likely to have had a past period of heavier drinking
and MAXDRINKS, an indicator of the largest number of
drinks consumed on an occasion over the lifetime (Hasin
et al., 2002; Saccone et al., 2000).

ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 2 POLYMORPHISM 1317
DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence by Population Subgroup
Past DSM-IV alcohol dependence was found among
14.8% (n  4), 4.4% (n  1), and 0% of the Russians,
Ashkenazis, and Sephardics, respectively (LRT; 22  5.86;
p  0.05). Current dependence was found among 4% (n 
1), 0%, and 4% (n  1) of the Russians, Ashkenazis, and
Sephardics, respectively (LRT; 22  1.49; p  0.47). Life-
time dependence was found among 14.8% (n  4), 4.4%
(n  1), and 4.0% (n  1) of the Russians, Ashkenazis, and
Sephardics, respectively (LRT; 22  2.54; p  0.28). All
subjects with current dependence had lifetime dependence,
by definition. Of subjects with current dependence, one was
a new-onset case, whereas the other (a Russian) had also
met criteria in the past.
DSM-IV Dependence Severity by Population Subgroup
The mean number of past alcohol dependence criteria in
the Russians, Ashkenazis, and Sephardics was 1.44 (SD,
1.60), 0.57 (SD, 0.99), and 0.52 (SD, 1.29), respectively
(Kruskal-Wallis test; 22  9.73; p  0.008). The level of
current dependence severity in the three groups was much
lower: 0.33 (SD, 0.78), 0.22 (SD, 0.060), and 0.28 (SD, 1.02)
in the Russians, Ashkenazis, and Sephardics, respectively
(Kruskal-Wallis test; 22  0.53; p  0.77). The mean
number of lifetime alcohol dependence criteria in the Rus-
sians, Ashkenazis, and Sephardics was 1.44 (SD, 1.60), 0.57
(SD, 0.99), and 0.56 (SD, 1.29), respectively (Kruskal-
Wallis test; 22  8.81; p  0.01). Thus, the Russians had
significantly greater past and lifetime dependence severity
than the other Israeli groups.
ADH2 and Population Subgroup
Table 2 shows the genotype and allele frequencies for
ADH2 among the Russians, Ashkenazis, and Sephardics.
The distribution of genotypes is consistent with Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium in all three groups. Sephardics were
more likely to have ADH2*2 than the other two groups and,
notably, had the most homozygous ADH2*2 subjects (21 
6.75; p  0.009). The frequency of the ADH2*2 allele did
not differ significantly between the Russian Ashkenazis and
the other Ashkenazis (21  0.01; p  0.92).
DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence by ADH2
Lifetime DSM-IV alcohol dependence was rare, occur-
ring in only 3 of the 68 subjects in whom there was ADH2
genotype information. The percentage of subjects meeting
criteria for lifetime DSM-IV alcohol dependence by geno-
type was 5.3, 4.2, and 0.0% among subjects with ADH2*1/1,
ADH2*1/2, and ADH2*2/2, respectively (LRT; 22  0.61;
p  0.74).
Regression Analysis
Table 3 shows the Poisson regression model of the rela-
tionship of ADH2 genotype to the outcome of lifetime
DSM-IV dependence severity. In this analysis, a three-level
ADH2 variable was not used, because of zero cells (no
subject homozygous for ADH2*2 had dependence symp-
toms, and no Russian was homozygous for ADH2*2).
Therefore, ADH2 was dichotomized into homozygous
ADH2*1/*1 versus homozygous or heterozygous ADH2*2.
In this model, controlling for population subgroup and
other variables, the ADH2*2 allele was significantly related
to a lower lifetime DSM-IV alcohol dependence severity.
Variance in current dependence severity was very low in
this sample and was unrelated to ADH2 (not shown).
Between-Group Exploration
Although the sample size was limited, within-group tests
of the ADH2/alcohol-dependence relationship were ex-
plored with Spearman correlations to provide preliminary
information. Among Israeli Ashkenazis, the relationship of
ADH2 genotype and severity of alcohol dependence symp-
toms was in the predicted direction at a trend level (r 
0.39; p  0.07). Among Sephardics, results were also in
the predicted direction but not statistically significant (r 
0.28; p  0.19). Among recent Russian immigrants, the
correlation was weaker than in the other two groups (r 
0.12; p  0.57).

dence severity among contrasting Jewish groups. In the full

group, ADH2*2 was protective against the severity of
DSM-IV alcohol-dependence symptoms, controlling for
numerous environmental factors. The direction of the re-
lationship was similar for a diagnosis of DSM-IV alcohol
dependence but did not reach statistical significance. This
indicates the value of incorporating more information into
an analysis through an outcome variable in continuous or
count form. Compared with other Caucasian populations
(Borras et al., 2000; Heath et al., 2001), Ashkenazis, Seph-
ardics, and recent Ashkenazi immigrants from the FSU had
a higher prevalence of ADH2*2, the protective form of
ADH2. This is consistent with other reports on ADH2 in
Jewish groups in the United States and Israel. Further-
more, the ADH2*2 allele frequency was higher in the Seph-
ardics, a result not found in the one previous study that
included both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews (Neumark et
al., 1998). Because these Jewish groups differ in other
genetic respects (Bonne-Tamir and Adam, 1992), this find-
ing is not entirely surprising. However, it should be con-
firmed in larger samples.
Before this article, data comparing alcohol dependence
in recent Russian immigrants and other Israelis have not
been available. Consistent with their background in a coun-
try with very high per capita alcohol consumption, the
recent Russian immigrants had a higher prevalence of past
DSM-IV alcohol-dependence diagnoses and greater mean
past and lifetime dependence severity than the other two
Israeli groups. However, the differences were found on past
but not current dependence, consistent with their drinking
histories. The lack of group differences in current drinking
variables may have resulted from the general tendency for
individuals to reduce their drinking as they age or from
acculturation to Israeli drinking patterns after arrival in
Israel. Further research in larger samples is needed to
clarify these issues.
Previously, we presented results suggesting that the ef-
fects of ADH2*2 on peak alcohol consumption were incon-
sistent in the recent Russian immigrants compared with the
other Ashkenazis and Sephardics (Hasin et al., 2002).
Within-group exploration suggested that ADH2*2 was pro-
tective against peak lifetime alcohol consumption among
the Ashkenazis and Sephardics, but not among the Rus-
sians. This suggested that the immigrants’ exposure to the
heavy-drinking environment of Russian culture, a powerful
environmental factor, overcame genetic protective effects.
In this study, within-group exploration showed a protective
effect for ADH2 against alcohol dependence across all
three groups—Ashkenazis, Sephardics, and recent Russian
immigrants—although the correlation was smaller among
the Russians. It is not clear why somewhat different results
emerged for these two important types of alcohol variables.
Reasons might include more pronounced cross-cultural in-
fluences on drinking levels than dependence symptoms,
cross-cultural differences in the emergence of dependence
symptoms in the presence of heavy drinking, or instability
due to small samples. Replication in a larger sample is
definitely warranted; this would allow testing of interac-
tions between ADH2*2 and population group by using both
alcohol consumption and dependence as outcomes.
It is possible to speculate that the higher mean depen-
dence severity among the Russian subgroup can be attrib-
uted to the absence of subjects with homozygous ADH2*2
rather than environmental exposure to very heavy drinking.
However, we favor the environmental explanation due to
the within-genotype distribution of dependence severity
when Russians were compared with the other two groups.
Within subjects homozygous for ADH2*1 as well as within
heterozygous subjects (ADH2*1/2), dependence severity
was higher among the Russians than among the other
subjects. However, the issue could usefully be addressed in
future studies, in which larger samples of Russian-Jewish
subjects should yield some with homozygous ADH2*2.
Association studies of the relationship between an allele
and a trait or disease can be powerful tools for gene map-
ping (Risch and Merikangas, 1996). However, a disease or
trait and an allele may both be increased within a subgroup
of a sample for unrelated reasons. If such a subgroup is
undetected, confounding due to population stratification
can lead to spurious findings (Lander and Schork, 1996;
Reich and Goldstein, 2001). This has led some investigators
to conclude that association studies can be conducted only
in related individuals (Ewens and Speilman, 1995). How-
ever, such a restriction may lead to a different set of biases,
and the issue remains controversial.
Many factors suggest that the results of this study were
not spurious due to undetected population stratification.
First, the results on ADH2 remained significant even after
the three main groups were identified and controlled in the
analysis. Second, the ADH2 literature shows that ADH2
effects on alcohol dependence are consistent in many coun-
tries and population groups, including samples of twins
(Heath et al., 2001; Neale et al., 1999). Third, methodolog-
ical research (Wacholder et al., 2000) indicates that the
degree of possible bias decreases as the number of unde-
tected potential strata (population subgroups) increases. In
this study, 18 countries of origin were reported among the
68 subjects (including many European countries for the
Ashkenazis and many countries in the Middle East and
North Africa for the Ashkenazis). Therefore, if country of
origin constituted strata, the large number of potential
strata reduced the likelihood of confounding (Wacholder et
al., 2000). Finally, the direction of results was consistent in
all three of our main subgroups and thus could not have
been determined entirely by an undetected trend among
subjects from only one country (i.e., one undetected
stratum).
Other methodological aspects of the study warrant not-
ing. Collaborative reports or biological indicators of
alcohol-consumption or -dependence measures were not
available. Although these could be included in future re-
search on this topic, they are probably most useful in
studies of current drinking. Our research pertained more to
ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 2 POLYMORPHISM 1319
peak times of heavier drinking in the past. In addition, the
informed consent procedures on privacy of the data as well
as the protection of privacy in the interview itself should
have reduced underreporting caused by concerns about
confidentiality. Also, future research on this topic would
benefit from larger samples that would allow more detailed
analysis of within- and between-group similarities and dif-
ferences in alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, and
the relationship of ADH2 to these.
As noted previously, we oversampled for men. In the
previous study that showed ADH2 effects on drinking
among Israelis, only men were included. In previous re-
ports on American Jews (Carr et al., 2002; Shea et al.,
2001), ADH2 effects were found only for men. The gener-
ally light drinking among the American Jews was even
lower among women than men, possibly limiting variance
and making it more difficult to show effects among female
American Jews. It was known from the outset that our
sample of Israelis would be too small to detect weak effects,
expected among women on the basis of the previous re-
ports. Therefore, we oversampled for men to maximize the
utility of this sample while including some women to check
for consistency between Israeli and American Jewish
women. Among the women in the sample, ADH2 effects
were consistent with those found for men (not shown), but
variance was very low. A future investigation of male-
female differences in ADH2 effects would be helpful in
elucidating this issue but will require a larger sample.
We did not report on DSM-IV abuse. Although we col-
lected data on this diagnosis, the  coefficient for current and
past DSM-IV alcohol abuse was low, indicating poor internal
consistency reliability. Other reports have also found poor
reliability and validity for DSM-IV alcohol abuse.
The results of this study indicate a protective effect of
ADH2*2 against alcohol-dependence symptoms in Jewish
samples. Thus, the ADH2*2 allele may constitute part of the
explanation for low levels of alcoholism among Jewish groups.
Work is needed in larger samples to clarify group similarities
and differences in these effects, as well as variability in results
when different alcohol phenotypes are studied. Furthermore,
studies of gene-environment interactions can provide valuable
general information on the relative contribution of genetic
and environmental causes to etiology. Little research in the
area of alcoholism has focused on the effects of a specific gene
across contrasting environmental circumstances. Because con-
sensus exists on the causal influence of both genetic and
environmental factors in the etiology of alcohol dependence,
consideration of both types of factors conjointly may provide
a clearer understanding of the effects of each when studying
disease etiology.
