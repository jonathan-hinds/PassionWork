1 Appendix
We begin by giving new formulae for estimation of Fst. Suppose we have a
biallelic marker in two populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Choose the
variant allele, and suppose that the allele has population frequency p1, p2 in
populations 1 and 2 respectively Set qi = 1 − pi. Then we can define Wright’s
Fst as
Fst = N/D (1)
where
N = p1(q2 − q1) + p2(q1 − q2) (2)
D = p1q2 + q1p2 = N + p1q1 + p2q2 (3)
This is a definition of Fst, a parameter measuring divergence at a given locus,
not a sample statistic. In this paper we are only interested in divergence mea-
sures of biallelic markers and the theory will always assume the populations are
homogeneous.
Suppose we have a set S of markers Ak(k = 1, . . .M). For marker k we define
now N [k] and D[k] in the obvious way. We now define F (S) = Fst for the marker
set S by
F (S) =
N(S)
D(S)
(4)
where
N(S) =
�M
k=1 N
[k]
M
(5)
D(S) =
�M
k=1 D
[k]
M
(6)
Given the form of equation (4) it is highly desirable to find unbiased estimators
of N [k],D[k] else the bias will eventually dominate the estimate. Fix for now,
marker k, and suppose the population frequencies are p1, p2 for the variant allele,
and we observe allele counts a1, a2 for the variant allele, b1, b2 for the reference
allele. Take ni = ai + bi, i = 1, 2. N = N
[k] is defined as (p1 − p2)
2
. A naive
estimator for N is
X = (a1/n1 − a2/n2)
2
We calculate the bias of X. Writing
X = ((a1/n1 − p1)− (a2/n2 − p2) + (p1 − p2))
2
Then
E(X) = (p1 − p2)
2
+ V ar(a1/n1|p1) + V ar(a2/n2|p2) (7)
= (p1 − p2)

+ p1(1− p1)/n1 + p2(1− p2)/n2 (8)

Define h1 = p1(1− p1) (2h1 is the heterozygosity at the marker for population
1). Then a natural estimator for h1 is
ĥ1 =
a1(n1 − a1)
n1(n1 − 1)
(9)
It is easy to check that ĥ1 is unbiased. Similarly define h2 for population 2,
with a corresponding estimator ĥ2 This is enough to show that:
N̂ = (a1/n1 − a2/n2)
2
− ĥ1/n1 − ĥ2/n2 (10)
is an unbiased estimator for N . Now
D = N + h1 + h2
which shows
D̂ = N̂ + ĥ1 + ĥ2 (11)
is an unbiased estimator for D.
By the Lehmann-Scheffé theorem [1, Theorem 4.2.2] N̂ and D̂ are uniformly
minimum variance unbiased estimators. No longer fixing a marker and writing
N̂ [k] for our estimator of N [k], and so on, we see that a natural estimator for
F (S) is
F̂ =
�
k N̂
[k]
�
k D̂
[k]
(12)
Note that (12) does not give an unbiased estimator. However the law of large
numbers does imply that as sample size or the number of unlinked markers
become large we get an estimator that is asymptotically consistent.
Given our assumptions, our estimates of N [k], D[k] are exactly unbiased both
here and in the section below. Our formulae are different from those of Weir
and Cockerham [6], at least when population sample sizes differ.
1.1 Estimators in the presence of inbreeding
The estimators above are not correct if there is inbreeding. We continue to
assume that within a population there is no structure, but no longer assume
that the pair of chromosomes of each sample are unrelated. Thus we may have
excess homozygosity compared with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
We extend our theory to this case. We give estimators ofN , D that are unbiased,
without explicitly estimating the inbreeding coefficients. Let x0, x1, x2 be the
number of samples of population 1 with 0, 1, 2 copies of the variant allele. Let
y0, y1, y2 be the corresponding numbers for population 2. Let
s = x0 + x1 + x2
t = y0 + y1 + y2
2

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONdoi: 10.1038/nature08365
We will require that s, t > 1. In the notation of the previous section:
a1 = x1 + 2x2
a2 = y1 + 2y2
n1 = 2s
n2 = 2t
which will lead to estimators for N,D. In the presence of inbreeding, these
estimators are incorrect. Note however that if we pick alleles randomly from
each diplotype, then we will obtain valid unbiased estimators. We can of course
then obtain more efficient estimators by averaging over our choice of alleles.
Select an allele at random from each diploid genotype. Let u be the allele count
for population 1, and v be the count for population 2. From equation (10) we
want to compute expected values of:
X = (u/s− v/t)
2
ĥ1 =
u(s− u)
s(s− 1)
ĥ2 =
v(t− v)
t(t− 1)
when our estimator for N is
N̂ = E(X)−E(ĥ1)/s−E(ĥ2)/t (13)
For X, we see that u has mean x1/2 + x2 and variance x1/4. Similarly v has
mean y1/2 + y2 and variance y1/4. It follows that
E(X) =
�
x1 + 2x2
2s
−
y1 + 2y2
2t
�2
+
x1
4s2
+
y1
4t2
For E(ĥ) we need the expected value of u(s− u). Standard binomial coefficient
identities show that
E(u(s− u)) = x0x2 + (x0 + x2)x1/2 + x1(x1 − 1)/4
Now it follows that:
E(ĥ1) =
x0x2 + (x0 + x2)x1/2 + x1(x1 − 1)/4
s(s− 1)
(14)
E(ĥ2) =
y0y2 + (y0 + y2)y1/2 + y1(y1 − 1)/4
t(t− 1)
(15)
We now can apply equation (13) to obtain N̂ . For D̂ we have, using D =
N + h1 + h2 the equation
D̂ = N̂ +E(ĥ1) +E(ĥ2) (16)

These formulae are slightly different from those of [5] who correct for inbreeding
by directly estimating an inbreeding ‘fixation index’ (see below) and state that
their estimates of the numerator N and denominator D are only ‘approximately
unbiased’. (see their equation (8)). We now obtain, using estimates over many
markers
F̂ =
�
k N̂
[k]
�
k D̂
[k]
(17)
where N̂ [k], D̂[k] are the estimators above, robust to inbreeding, for marker
k. Just as before, the estimator of (17) is not unbiased but asymptotically
consistent as the number of unlinked markers becomes large.
The same ideas lead to a simple estimator of the inbreeding coefficient, pI . the
probability, in a sample from a population, that the two alleles at a locus are
identical by descent (IBD). For our case, with an assumed homogeneous popula-
tion, this is the same as Wright’s fixation index F . (See [4, page 154]). Consider
population 1, with the same notation as above. Let H be the probability that
two alleles from an individual are heterozygous. Then
H = (1− pI)h
so that pI = (h−H)/h. An unbiased estimator of H is
Ĥ =
x1
s
Thus we obtain a natural estimate of pI :
p̂I =
�
(ĥ− Ĥ)
�
ĥ
(18)
where we sum over all SNPs in our data.
We have not yet worked out the theory, but it would appear that these estimators
of Fst have, in the absence of inbreeding, standard errors that are only a little
increased from the ‘optimal’ estimators using equations (10, 11).
2 f-statistics
We now discuss our f -statistics. f4 is the simplest. We have 4 distinct popu-
lations W,X, Y, Z. An allele has population frequencies w, x, y, z respectively
We observe counts w0, w1 of the allele and the complementary allele in a sample
from population W. Similarly we observe counts x0, x1; y0, y1; z0, z1. We will
assume that the total count for each population is at least 2. Thus the natural
(naive) estimator of w is
w� =
w0
(w0 + w1)

with similar definitions of x�, y�, z�. We wish to form unbiased estimates of
quantities such as (w−x)(y− z) which we term an f4-statistic. It is easy to see
that the naive estimate
f4(W,X, Y, Z) = (w
� − x�)(y� − z�)
indeed is an unbiased estimator. Next suppose we want an estimator (f3-
statistic) for (w−x)(w−y) where w appears twice. Consider the naive estimator:
q = (w� − x�)(w� − y�) Then we can write q as
q = ((w� − w)− (x� − x) + (w − x))((w� − w)− (y� − y) + (w − y))
This shows that the bias of q is E(w� − w)
2
. Let nW = w0 + w1 be the total
allele count for W. Then
E(w� − w)
2
=
w(1− w)
nW
Define hW = w(1− w)
(2 hW is the heterozygosity at the marker for population W ). Then a natural
estimator for hW is ĥW = defined analogously to h1.
f3(W,X, Y ) = (w
� − x�)(w� − y�)− ĥW /nW
and f3 is an unbiased estimator of (w − x)(w − y). Similarly we can define
f2(W,X) = (w
� − x�)(w� − x�)−
