Supplementary Notes
Identifying departures from the general pattern of genetics mirroring geography
To identify departures between the PC-based map and geography, we identified individuals who are
empirical outliers in PC1-PC2 space relative to their geographic positions (Supplementary Figure
2). Individuals identified as outliers are likely to have mis-specified ancestral origins or have recently
migrated. More careful inspection of the demographic information for outlier individuals reveals in
many cases circumstances that partially explain their at first unexpected genetic positioning (see
next section of Supplemental Information: “Notes on outlier individuals”).
We applied a similar approach to detect countries who are empirical outliers with respect to
the discrepancy between the PC-based map and geography (Supplementary Fig. 1). There is only
one obvious outlier, which is Slovakia; however Slovakia is represented in our data set by only one
individual, and based on the individual’s position in PC1-PC2 space it’s possible this outlier may
actually have had Italian, rather than Slovakian ancestry. The Russian Federation is less-striking
as an outlier, and appears to lie too far “west” genetically, which may be a result of small sample
size (n = 6) or simply that the Russians sampled here have ancestry from a location further west
than the proxy location for Russia (Moscow) would suggest.
We find similar results when we plot Euclidean distances between countries in PC1-PC2 space
vs. geographic distances, and find a strong correlation between the two (Supplementary Fig. 5a,
r2 = 0.68). Many of the empirical outliers are pairwise comparisons involving either Slovakia (SK)
or Russia (RU). In addition, even after excluding Russia and Slovakia (Supplementary Fig. 5),
many of the pairwise comparisons with large residuals involve comparisons with countries that
have small sample sizes, [e.g., Kosovo (KS), Slovenia (SI), Scotland (Sct), Finland (FI), Cyprus
(CY), Yugoslavia (YG), Croatia (HR)]. This suggests that outlier points are simply due to sampling
variation, and not strong departures from a general model where PC1-PC2 position is principally
determined by geography.
This pattern is supported when we sample bootstrap distributions on the mean PC1-PC2 posi-
tion for each country by bootstraping over individuals within each country. We note this bootstrap
analysis is approximate in that we use PC1 and PC2 values computed from the original sample
(i.e., we do not recompute PC1 and PC2 for each bootstrap sample of individuals, nor do we
bootstrap over loci).1 Furthermore for small samples, bootstrapping is biased (it underestimates
the sampling variance–an extreme case being that, for countries with a single individual observed,
the bootstrap distributions show zero variance) and it produces artifacts in sampling bootstrap
distributions (e.g. discontinuous, multimodal distributions; the problems would be worse if we
bootstrapped the median rather than mean positions). With these caveats in mind, the bootstrap
distributions (Supplementary Fig. 6) convey that mean PC1 and PC2 positions are typically much
more poorly estimated for countries from Eastern and Northern Europe. This further clarifies
1A complication to fully bootstrapping PCA results is that the sampling with replacement step necessarily repli-
cates individuals in the sample. For large-scale SNP data, PCA is very sensitive to the presence of replicated
individuals, and typically separates such individuals from the rest of the sample on their own axis of variation.

how the observation of countries from Eastern and Northern Europe as outliers in Supplementary
Figs. 1 and 5 are more likely a function of small sample sizes, then a true biological signal for
differentiation.
In conclusion, the plots of country PC1-PC2 position vs. geographic position have no obvious
outliers that cannot be explained plausibly by small sample size and/or the pitfalls of assuming a
single proxy location for a large country (e.g. Russia). While there may be more subtle signals of
unique population history in the data, the absence of empirical outliers from well-sampled countries
suggests that the dominant signal in the data is that the genetics of European populations mirrors
their geography.
Notes on outlier individuals
Here we list more details on the demographic information for a sample of outlier individuals.
The examples show how the rule of using reported grandparental origins as a proxy for genetic
ancestry can in rare cases be misleading. Sometimes country of birth, parental origins, or language
information are more useful.
• Individual 44556 has 4 Italian grandparents, but was born in France, speaks French, and
clusters with French individuals.
• Individual 7147 has 4 Russian grandparents, but was born in Romania, speaks Romanian,
and is placed between Switzerland and Romania in the PC1-PC2 plot.
• Individual 43874 has 4 Swiss grandparents, but was born in Italy, speaks Italian, and clusters
with Italian individuals.
• Individual 14215 has 4 Swiss grandparents but has parents who are Italian, speaks Italian,
and clusters Italian. Israel is the individual’s country of birth.
• Individual 34088 has 4 German GPs but was born in Hungary, speaks Hungarian, and inter-
estingly clusters with Italian individuals.
• The cluster of 5 outlier Italian individuals located well “southwest”of Italy, includes 3 individ-
uals with unobserved grandparental origins and the other 2 have all four grandparents from
Italy. Three of the five speak Italian, the other two have unobserved language data. Notably
one of the individuals is from the LOLIPOP sub-study and the others are from Lausanne - so
both studies identified these outlier Italian individuals, making it unlikely to be the result of
some artifact that occurred within one of the two sub-studies from which we draw our data.
• Individual 13011 was born in Slovakia but has no observed grandparental or language infor-
mation.

1 Detection of outlier countries. a) Cumulative density of the distances between
each country’s PC1-PC2 position and their geographic position. To put PC coordi-
nates and geographical coordinates on the same scale, coordinates along each axis
are normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before computing the dis-
tances. An empirical approach is taken whereby outliers are labeled as individuals
falling in the upper 2.5% tail of this distance distribution (97.5% quantile denoted by
horizontal gray line, corresponding distance threshold marked by vertical red-line).
b) Median “south-north” position for each country vs. latitude. c) Median “west-
east” position for each country vs. longitude. In (b) and (c) vertical error bars are
intervals of +/- 2 standard errors. For samples with 1 individual, error bars are omit-
ted. Horizontal error bars denote the maximal and minimal latitudinal/longitudinal
range of the country (n.b., these values are approximate and for Russia we use rough
values corresponding to the European portion of Russia). The solid line is based on
a regression of position in PC-space vs. geographic space (r2 = 0.71 PC-coordinate
vs. latitude; r2 = 0.82 PC-coordinate vs. longitude). Dashed lines denote a region
in which 97.5% of all countries fall with respect to the magnitude of the residuals of
the regression. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6

4 Quantile-quantile plots for − log10(p-value) distributions from simulated
genome-wide association studies where phenotype mean is a function of
latitude (top row) or longitude (bottom row). The phenotype is simulated
to have no underlying genetic basis and a mean trait value that depends on lati-
tude or longitude with residual variance about the mean. Each column represents a
different percentage of total phenotypic variance explained by latitude or longitude.
The inflation statistic (see Methods) takes values of 1 when the observed distribu-
tion of p-values matches the expected distribution; values greater than one might
reflect an underlying genetic basis to the trait, but in this case the phenotype has no
genetic basis, so values greater than one are evidence of spurious association. The
dashed lines mark the (0.05,0.5,0.95) quantiles for the observed p-values under the
null distribution of no underlying genetic effect. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9

1 Individuals are assigned to the nearest possible geographic origin based on the latitude and longitude
predicted by the linear model (see text)
2 Individuals are assigned to the latitude and longitude predicted by the linear model
3 As a reference point, we assess performance if all individuals are assigned to a central point in Europe
(here taken to be Austria). Distances to Austria are given in kilometers. 4 Proportion of individuals assigned
correctly to the correct geographic origin/group. 5 Quantiles of the distribution of distances in kilometers
between assigned location and observed geographic origin.
Table 4: Summary of assignment results using both discrete and continuous assignment methods.
Because Europe has many closely spaced countries, assigned locations can be geographically close
to the correct origin (per country median error often less than 500km) even though the proportions
of individuals assigned correctly to a specific origin/group are low.
