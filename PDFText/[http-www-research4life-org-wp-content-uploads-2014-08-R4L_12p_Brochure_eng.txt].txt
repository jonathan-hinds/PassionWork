WHAT IS RESEARCH4LIFE?
What’s  available? 
The concept of Research4Life is simple: research in 
support of quality of life is better informed when it is 
based on the most recent, high quality and relevant 
scientific knowledge.
However, until some ten years ago, the demand for  
scientific literature in developing countries had 
gone unfulfilled with hundreds of thousands of 
researchers, academics, students, and practitioners 
struggling to gain access to current scientific 
information.
While practitioners and students were unable to 
access the literature and acquire the knowledge 
they needed, researchers and academics were 
confronted with mounting difficulties in conducting 
their research, updating their teaching curricula, and 
publishing their findings in peer-reviewed journals.
Research4Life is the collective name for four public 
private partnerships which seek to help achieve the 
UN’s Millennium Development Goals by providing 
the developing world with access to critical scientific 
research.
Research4Life empowers universities, colleges,
research institutes and government ministries as well
as non-governmental agencies, extension centres
and hospitals with access to scientific knowledge
that was never before imagined.
Since 2002, the four Research4Life programmes have 
given people at more than 7000 institutions in over 
100 countries and territories in the developing world 
free or low cost access to 44,000 peer-reviewed 
international scientfic journals, books, and databases
provided by the world’s leading science publishers.
  
• Online access to over 44,000 peer-reviewed   
   international scientific journals, books, and 
   databases
• Full-text articles which can be downloaded for
   saving, printing or reading on screen
• Searching by keyword, subject, author or language
• Resources available in several languages
• Training in information literacy and promotional 
   support

In medical work and in training and in research, information is 
something very crucial… We need to know what is done elsewhere. 
Before we knew about HINARI and Research4Life, finding information 
was very difficult. HINARI helps us to have the data we need in real 
time. We just have to go to the website, do the appropriate search and 
download the resources that are there. It solves the problem of training 
and treating patients.

HELP & SUPPORT
Training and Outreach
 
Eligibility
In order for librarians and researchers to make the 
best use of the resources provided, we understand 
the importance of training and effective promotion of 
the services.
The partners are committed to providing appropriate
long-term training on the use of online resources and
more. A range of training modules produced by the
partners and field-tested by librarians and 
information managers from many developing 
countries are available online.
  
Publicly funded non profit institutions in most low 
and middle income countries are eligible to register 
for access to the Research4Life content. A detailed 
list of qualifying countries can be found at
http://www.research4life.org/eligibility
Please note that for some countries there are some 
exceptions to eligibility for certain titles. In addition, 
the eligibility of countries, areas, and territories will 
change as their development indicators change.
If you have any questions regarding technical details 
and requirements please email the relevant contact:
hinari@who.int or agora@fao.org or oare@unep.org 
or ardi@wipo.int
The Research4Life programme is a public-private 
partnership between WHO, FAO, UNEP, WIPO, 
Cornell and Yale Universities, technology partners 
such as Microsoft and more than 190 science 
publishers facilitated by the International 
Association of STM Publishers. The partnership’s 
goal is to reduce the gap in scientfic knowledge 
between industrialized countries and the 
developing world.
If you are an interested in becoming a partner or 
you are an institution seeking research support 
please get in touch.

HINARI is very essential for this institution to meet the 
demands of the academic staff and with the 
dwindling of funds for journal subscriptions. We have 
seen HINARI transform institutions like ours.
Launched in 2002, HINARI is managed by the World
Health Organization in partnership with Yale 
University Library and over 150 global publishers.
5600 institutions in over 100 countries have already 
registered for access to HINARI, which provides 
access to over 13,000 peer-reviewed journals covering 
medicine, nursing and related health and social 
sciences.  It also includes many databases, indexes 
and reference books, as well as journals in several 
languages. The journals can be searched through a 
special and easy-to-use version of PubMed (Medline).
