Hanna Wallach develops machine learning methods for analyzing the structure, content, and dynamics of social
processes. Her work is inherently interdisciplinary: she collaborates with political scientists, sociologists, and
journalists to learn how organizations work in practice by analyzing publicly available interaction data such as
public record email networks, document dumps, press releases, meeting transcripts, and news articles. Hanna’s
research has had broad impact in machine learning, natural language processing, and the nascent field of
computational social science. In 2010 her work on infinite belief networks won the best paper award at the
AISTATS conference, in 2014 she was named one of Glamour magazine’s “35 Women Under 35 Who Are Changing
the Tech Industry,” and in 2015 she was profiled in O’Reilly’s book on “Women in Data.” She is the recipient of
several NSF grants, an IARPA grant, and a grant from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
Hanna is committed to increasing diversity and has worked for over a decade to address the underrepresentation
of women in computing. She founded two projects—the first of their kind—to increase women’s involvement in
free and open source software development: Debian Women and the GNOME Women’s Summer Outreach
Program. She also founded the annual Women in Machine Learning Workshop, which is now in its eleventh year.
