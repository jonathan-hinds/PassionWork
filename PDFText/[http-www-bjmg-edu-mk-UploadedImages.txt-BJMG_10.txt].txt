 ABSTRACT
 An analysis of eight Alu insertion loci (ACE, 
ApoA1, PV92, TPA25, NBC27, NBC102, NBC148 
and NBC182) was carried out in three ethnic groups 
of the South Caucasus (Abkhazians, Armenians and 
Georgians). Genetic differentiation between these 
groups (Gst = 1%) was half as much as in European 
populations and four time less than in populations 
of Dagestan. Although it was not possible to deter-
mine a contribution of Neolithic farmers to the Cau-
casian gene pool, the principal component analysis 
showed clear differences between these populations 
and those of Europe, Siberia and Asia. No evidence 
of correlation between genetic and linguistic data in 
our populations was disclosed. However, long-term 
habitation on common territory has led to common 
cultural, anthropological and detectable genetic 
traits.

 INTRODUCTION
 Because of the geographic peculiarities of the 
Caucasus, study of its human populations offers an 
opportunity to assess the influence of geographic 
barriers on their genetic structure. Previous pub-
lications, based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
data, have shown that genetic relationships reflect 
geographic rather than linguistic relationships [1-3]. 
Despite the presence of the Caucasus Mountains as 
a potentially significant barrier to gene-flow, consid-
erable correlation between pairs of geographically-
distant populations has been observed [2,4]. Also, 
these mountains had no detectable influence on the 
genetic structure of the Caucasus populations [3]. 
These results led to the proposal of genetic drift as 
the major factor influencing the genetic structure of 
the Caucasus populations [5,6]. An analysis based 
on mtDNA and Alu-insertion data has also shown, 
that the Caucasus populations are more similar to 
European rather than to western Asian populations, 
whereas Y-chromosome analysis revealed a closer 
relationship to the latter populations [3,5]. Mito-
chondrial DNA and Y-chromosome-based analyses 
have also shown an affinity of Caucasus populations 
with Near East [5,7].
 The Alu family of short interspersed elements 
is a relatively stable autosomal polymorphic marker 
with a unique mutational mechanism, for which the 
ancestral state is the absence of Alu insertion. Be-
cause it reflects both maternal and paternal history, 
an Alu insertion polymorphism is a highly informa-
tive tool for studying the genetic structure of human 
populations [8].
 We have analyzed three populations from the 
South Caucasus: Abkhazians (North-Caucasian lan-
guage family, Abkhaz-Adyghe language subgroup), 
Georgians (Kartvelian language family) and Arme-
nians (Indo-European language family) to assess 
the genetic diversity of linguistically and historical-
ly different, but related populations in this specific 
geographic region [9]. Because the Georgian nation

GENETICS OF THE SOUTH CAUCASUS
includes multiple ethnic groups we examined the 
Mingrelian population inasmuch as it shares signifi-
cant traits with Abkhazians from their centuries-old 
interaction. Armenians are a separate ethnic group, 
which originated from Neolithic tribes of the Arme-
nian Uplands. In the 12th- 11th centuries BC, this 
group gained Hittite, Hurrite and partially Abkhaz-
Adyghe and Kartvel elements. Later, in 8th-7th 
centuries BC, a Cimmerian-Scythian element was 
added to its gene pool. We also compared our re-
sults with those from other populations of Eurasia.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS
 Blood samples (212 in total) from unrelated in-
dividuals from the following three ethnic groups: 
Abkhazians (98), Georgians (Mingrelians) (72), Ar-
menians (42) were collected in the Abkhazian Re-
public after informed consent was obtained from all 
participants. The origin of all subjects participating 
in this study was ascertained over three generations. 
Published data for additional ethnic groups has been 
taken for comparison in this study (Table 1).

 DNA samples were extracted from peripheral 
blood lymphocytes using a phenol-chloroform 
extraction method [10]. All the samples were 
genotyped for eight Alu insertion markers (ACE, 
ApoA1, pv92, TPA25, Ya5NBC27, Ya5NBC102, 
Ya5NBC148, Ya5NBC182). Primer sequences have 
been described previously [11].
 Allele frequencies and heterozygosity were de-
termined by direct counting. A principal component 
analysis made use of the Statistica 6.0 package. The 
Gst value (the coefficient of gene differentiation) 
has been calculated as described by Nei and Chesser 
[13]. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evalu-
ated by an exact test [14].
 RESULTS
 Allele frequencies of the eight Alu insertions 
in the three groups are shown in Table 2. In all the 
loci, two alleles were revealed with the exception of 
ApoA1 in Armenians, which is fixed in the presence 
of an Alu insertion. Two of 24 tests performed for 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium indicated significant 
departure from equilibrium (ApoA1 in Georgians 
and Armenians; p <0.05). Thus, these deviations 
most likely represent random statistical fluctuation.
 The average expected heterozygosity for each 
group varied from 0.359 to 0.398 (Table 2). The ex-
pected average heterozygosity for each marker in 
all populations was 0.047 for ApoA1 to 0.492 for 
TPA25.
 The standard test for heterogeneity of allele 
frequencies between the groups showed substantial 
heterogeneity. While there are only two alleles in the 
locus, Gst value is equivalent to Wright’s Gst [15]. 
The Gst values ranged from 0.001 for the NBC27 
locus to 0.023 for NBC182. The average Gst for the 
whole dataset was 0.010, which is almost one half 
that for European populations (0.018) [16]. This re-
sult is most similar to that obtained for the North 
Caucasus populations by Kutuev et al. [17], where-
as the level of genetic differentiation only in the 
populations of Dagestan, for the same loci (except 
B65, NBC123 and NBC51) was 0.045 [18]. The Gst 
value that was obtained for both North and South 
Caucasus populations and for different Alu markers 
(ACE, TPA25, PV92, APO, FXIIIB, D1, A25, B65) 
was 0.113 [4].
 The level of genetic differentiation for each pair 
of our three groups has been estimated. The Gst val-
ue for Abkhazian and Georgian population was the 
same as for Georgian and Armenian populations, 
i.e., 0.007. The differentiation between Abkhazian 
and Georgian populations was 0.009.
 To assess the genetic relationships of the three 
groups, a principal component analysis was per-
formed (Figure 1). The first two components to-
gether account for 55.4% of the observed variance. 
The first principal component accounts for 36.3%. 
It separates the studied Caucasian populations from 
populations of Central Asia and Siberia.
 The studied Abkhazian group is closer to the 
European rather than to Asian populations along the 
first axis. It is clearly separated from Siberian and 
Asian populations, but there are no visible correla-
tions on plot with Volga-Ural and Dagestan popula-
tions according to their linguistic or geographic at-
tributes. The Abkhazian population from the studied 
group appears closer to populations of Dagestan, 
who are placed together except Karanogays, posi-
tioned with Kazakhs and Uzbeks. This can be ex-
plained by an apparent Asian origin of Karanogays 
[19]. With the exception of that, Dagestan, Central 
Asia and Siberian populations are clearly separated

from each other. Armenian and Georgian popula-
tions cluster together with Tatars, Mordvinians and 
Finns. Regarding the second principal component, 
the latter are located close to Uralic speaking groups 
such as Mari, Udmirts and Komis. This concurs with 
the idea of Finno-Ugric Turkish interaction during 
past millennia.
 DISCUSSION
 The average Gst value for all markers in the three 
South Caucasus groups was 0.010. It is half as much 
as that for European populations (0.018) [16] and it 
is significantly lower than Gst obtained for moun-
tain inhabitants of Dagestan (0.045) [18]. The Gst 
calculated for the Dagestan populations is based on 
the same markers that we used in this study. In spite 
of the absence in our study of three Alu loci used by 
Yunusbayev et al. [18] (NBC51, B65, A25), the dif-
ference in genetic differentiation between the South 
Caucasus and Dagestan populations is obvious. It 
was shown that pure drift was not the sole reason for 
such differentiation in Dagestan and could possibly 
be the result of migrations and isolation in steppe 
and mountain populations, respectively. Thus, the 
possible reason for the difference in the Gst value is 
that the isolation in Abkhazian settlements is not as 
strong as it is in Dagestan, where an aul (a remote 
mountain village) can be considered as an isolate 
[20]. Furthermore, the populations studied do not 
represent the aul inhabitants. The main reason for 
the expected genetic differences in Abkhazian pop-
ulations, which can be seen on the PC plot, could be 
historical and genetic distinction. The Mingrelians 
are the descendants of Georgian tribes, which in-
habited the central region and foothills of Colchis 
on the territory of present-day western Georgia and 
Abkhazia. Due to centuries-old neighborhoods and

contacts with western Georgian ethnic groups, the 
Abkhazians gained common anthropological and 
cultural traits from them. Although anthropologi-
cally Abkhazians are most close to western Geor-
gian groups, which are intermediate between Pontic 
and Armenoid types (while signs of Caucasian type 
are not expressed), Abkhazians are more culturally 
and linguistically close to North-Caucasian Adygs. 
The Indo-European speaking Armenians are quite 
different from our two other groups, both linguisti-
cally and anthropologically. Yet the genetic differ-
ence between them and the two other groups (0.007) 
is slightly lower than that between the Abkhazian 
and Georgian populations (0.009). The main reason 
for this could be the penetration of Kartvel and Ab-
khaz-Adyghe elements to the Armenian gene pool 
because of dispersal settling of different Armenian 
groups in the Caucasus.
 Although classical markers (blood groups, se-
rum proteins and red cell enzymes) showed clinal 
frequency distribution from Anatolia to Europe, 
later studies did not show any such signs [21]. In a 
previous study [4], it was shown that Alu insertion 
analyses along with mtDNA data places the Cau-
casus populations alongside European populations. 
It was proposed then that the Caucasus populations 
represent an earlier “layer” of the European popula-
tions [22]. That European and Caucasus populations 
are close to each other has now been confirmed 
[17].
 Our principal component analysis clearly dis-
tinguishes the populations of the Caucasus and Asia. 
However, we cannot exclude a Neolithic contribu-
tion to the contemporary gene pool. The possible 
reason for the absence of the frequency distribution 
gradient can be genetic drift, reinforced by isolation 
that could conceal the influence of Neolithic farm-
ers on the Caucasus populations [1,21]. Our study 
can neither confirm nor disprove both these as-
sumptions. Markers with high powers of resolution 
should be used to determine the extent of impact on 
the Caucasus populations from the Near East.
 In summary, our analysis of eight Alu loci in 
three South Caucasian groups revealed a close re-
lationship between them. The geographic neigh-
borhood showed significant influence on genetic 
proximity in spite of linguistic and cultural differ-
ences between the groups. Our results confirm that 
geographic differentiation correlate with genetic 
diversity to a greater degree than linguistic differ-
entiation. While an Alu insertion marker does not 
have enough power of resolution to assess the con-
tribution of the influence of Neolithic farmers on the 
Caucasian gene pool, it clearly separates both South 
and North Caucasus populations (except Kara-
nogays) from Siberian and Asian populations.
