Summary
Mitochondrial DNA variability in two Slavonic-speaking populations of the northwestern Balkan peninsula,
Bosnians (N = 144) and Slovenians (N = 104), was studied by hypervariable segments I and II (HVS I and
II) sequencing and restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the mtDNA coding region. The
majority of the mtDNA detected in Southern Slavonic populations falls into the common West Eurasian mito-
chondrial haplogroups (e.g., H, pre-V, J, T, U, K, I, W, and X). About 2% of the Bosnian mtDNAs encompass East
Eurasian and African lineages (e.g., M and L1b, respectively). The distribution of mtDNA subclusters in Bosnians,
Slovenians and the neighbouring European populations reveals that the common genetic substratum characteristic
for Central and Eastern European populations (such as Germans, Poles, Russians and Finns) penetrates also South
European territories as far as the Western Balkans. However, the observed differentiation between Bosnian and
Slovenian mtDNAs suggests that at least two different migration waves of the Slavs may have reached the Balkans
in the early Middle Ages.
Introduction
Human history of the Balkan Peninsula is very com-
plex because of multiple migration processes that oc-
curred there since the initial occupation by anatomi-
cally modern humans in Palaeolithic times. According
to archaeological studies, the Balkans were settled dur-
ing the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods (Pinhasi et al.
2000). Moreover, the Neolithic expansion from Ana-
tolia into Europe spread through the Balkans and led
to increasing population density in the Balkan area, al-
though its Mesolithic populations seem to have been
very scarce (Lahr et al. 2000; Pinhasi et al. 2000). Im-
portant episodes of the immediate impact on the cultural
and linguistic nature of Europe were the Urnfield cul-
ture migrations that occurred in the late Bronze Age. It

has been suggested that the bearers of this culture col-
onized the entire area from the Baltic southwards, over
the Alps to the Adriatic Sea and Apennines (Piggott,
1965). From about 1000 B.C., the Balkan Peninsula
was already inhabited by the Illyrians in the west and
by the Thracians in the south-east between the Danube
and the Aegean Sea. According to archaeological and
historical data, the Slavs invaded the Balkan Peninsula
as early as the 2nd century A.D. and advanced as far as
Greece and even settled on the Peloponnesus and sev-
eral Aegean islands (Sedov, 1995; Šavli et al. 1996). As
a result of the settlement movements of the Slavs in the
Balkans, beginning in the 5th-6th centuries A.D., the
various South Slavonic groups gradually evolved (Šavli
et al. 1996). It has been suggested that the Illyrians were
assimilated by Slavonic tribes and became the ancestors
of modern Slovenians, Croatians and Bosnians, whereas
the Serbians may be the descendants of the Thracians
assimilated by the Slavs. However, the origin and ge-
netic history of the Southern Slavonic populations is
still poorly understood.

Bosnian and Slovenian mtDNAs
Genetic studies of the Southern Slavs by the use of
molecular markers of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
and the Y chromosome have attracted the interest of
population geneticists (Calafell et al. 1996; Comas et al.
1999; Richards et al. 2000; Rosser et al. 2000; Tolk
et al. 2000; Zaharova et al. 2000; Sterlinko et al. 2001;
Torroni et al. 2001). However, mtDNA population data
are so far available only for Bulgarians (Calafell et al.
1996; Richards et al. 2000) and a Croatian sample from
the Adriatic islands (Tolk et al. 2000). These studies have
failed to demonstrate significant differences between
Southern Slavonic populations and most other Euro-
peans. It was found that Bulgarians are close to West-
ern Europeans in terms of genetic distances (Calafell
et al. 1996). The study of Croatians revealed that their
mtDNA cluster composition, as well as frequency pat-
tern, is generally similar to other European and Near
Eastern populations, with some deviations toward Asian
(A, F) and African (L2a) mtDNA haplogroups (Tolk
et al. 2000). These results suggest that the genetic his-
tory of the South Slavonic populations inhabiting the
Balkan Peninsula is very complex and needs further in-
vestigation. In order to characterize the mtDNA struc-
ture and diversity in Southern Slavs, we have performed
sequence analysis of the two hypervariable segments of
the mtDNA control region and typed the mtDNA for
coding region RFLP markers in samples from Bosnian
and Slovenian individuals. To investigate the human his-
tory of the Balkan Peninsula, these results are compared
with the data from other European populations.
Materials and Methods
Population Samples
Population samples of 104 Slovenians and 144 Bosni-
ans living in different regions of Slovenia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina, respectively, were studied. All individuals
were maternally unrelated and it was stated that their
maternal grandmothers had been born in the area con-
sidered for this study. The Slovenian samples were col-
lected randomly over the whole country. The sampled
Bosnian individuals were of Serbian and Croatian ori-
gin. They speak a Bosnian dialect of the Serbo-Croatian
language of the Slavonic linguistic group, to which the
Slovenian language also belongs. Nevertheless, it is ac-
cepted by linguists that the Slovenian language dis-
tinguishes itself from Southern Slavonic languages, to
which the Serbo-Croatian language belongs, and may
belong to Western Slavonic languages, thus preserving
some proto-Slavonic linguistic characteristics and even
a lexical relationship with Baltic languages (Šavli et al.
1996).
mtDNA Analysis
Total genomic DNA was prepared from whole blood
(Bosnian samples) and buccal swabs (Slovenian samples)
by means of cell lysis in the presence of proteinase K and
1% SDS, followed by phenol/chlorophorm extractions.
Hypervariable segments I and II (HVS I and II) of the
mtDNA noncoding control region (CR) were ampli-
fied and sequenced as described elsewhere (Malyarchuk
et al. 2002). The nucleotide sequences of HVS I from
position 15999 to 16400 and HVS II from position 30
to 407 were determined and compared with the Cam-
bridge reference sequence (CRS: Anderson et al. 1981;
Andrews et al. 1999).
To determine the haplogroup status of the CR se-
quences, RFLP typing was performed by restriction
endonuclease analysis of PCR-amplified mtDNA frag-
ments using the same primer pairs and amplification
conditions as described by Torroni et al. (1996, 1997),
Macaulay et al. (1999), and Finnilä et al. (2000). To
screen the restriction site polymorphisms, 10–12 µl of
the respective unpurified PCR products were digested
for two hours at 37◦C with 5U of the appropriate en-
donucleases and electrophoresed in 8% polyacrylamide
gels followed by ethidium bromide staining. The sam-
ples were typed for a restricted set of RFLPs (Table 1)
that were diagnostic of all major West Eurasian and East
Asian clusters, on the basis of the hierarchical mtDNA
RFLP scheme (Macaulay et al. 1999; Torroni et al. 2001;
Yao et al. 2002). Control region sequences, belonging
to haplogroups pre-HV, N1b, L1b and Z, were identi-
fied on the basis of the HVS I and II motifs classifica-
tion (Chen et al. 2000; Richards et al. 2000; Yao et al.
2002). Sequence classification into mtDNA subclusters
was based on the nomenclatures of Richards et al. (1998;
2000) and Macaulay et al. (1999).

Phylogenetic and Statistical Analysis
For phylogenetic analysis, all available published data on
the HVS I -RFLP mtDNA variability in West Eurasian
populations was used (Richards et al. 2000; Meinilä et al.
2001; Mogentale-Profizi et al. 2001; Forster et al. 2002).
To classify the Slavonic mtDNA haplotypes, a phylogeo-
graphic approach, based on the phylogenetic analysis of
the spatial distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes and
haplogroups determined as a monophyletic clade, was
performed (Richards et al. 1998).
The population genetic structure was analyzed us-
ing methods implemented in the Arlequin 2.0 software
(Schneider et al. 2000). The statistical significance of
FST-values was estimated by permutation analysis using
1000 permutations. Intrapopulation diversities (h) were
calculated using the formulas (Nei & Tajima, 1981) as
implemented in Arlequin 2.0.
For the CR sequence sharing analysis, HVS I and
HVS II haplotypes of Bosnians and Slovenians, as
well as other European populations, were compared.
Data from the following populations were used: 436
Poles and 201 Russians (Malyarchuk et al. 2002); 200
Southern Germans (Lutz et al. 1998); 101 Austrians
(Parson et al. 1998); 150 Western Germans (Baasner et al.
1998; Baasner & Madea, 2000); 109 North-Western
Germans (Pfeiffer et al. 1999); 192 Finns (Finnilä et al.
2001); 30 Bulgarians (Calafell et al. 1996); 83 Italians
(Tagliabracci et al. 2001); 204 French-speaking individ-
uals from France and Switzerland (Rousselet & Mangin,
1998; Dimo-Simonin et al. 2000); and 241 Portuguese
(Pereira et al. 2000).
Results and Discussion
The analysis of HVS I and II variability in combination
with RFLP typing of the coding region haplogroup-
specific sites in a total sample of 248 Bosnian and Slove-
nian individuals allowed detection of 200 different mi-
tochondrial haplotypes (Table 2). 106 different haplo-
types were found among the 144 subjects from Bosnia-
Herzegovina and 85 different haplotypes were identi-
fied in the sample of 104 Slovenians. This high mtDNA
haplotype diversity ensures that only 10 shared HVS I
and II haplotypes were found between the populations
studied.
It has been found that the CR sequences are clus-
tered, according to the Eurasian mtDNA classification
(Macaulay et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2000; Finnilä et al.
2001; Yao et al. 2002), into 20 haplogroups and their
subgroups: H, HV2, pre-V, pre-HV, U1, U2, U3, U4,
U5, K, J∗ , J1a, T∗ , T1, I, N1b, X, W, M∗ , and Z. In
addition, a single African-specific sequence type, be-
longing to haplogroup L1b, was revealed in a Bosnian
sample.
The haplogroup pre-HV, which is defined by HVS
I motif 16126-16362 associated with +14766 MseI
site and 73A variant in HVS II (Macaulay et al. 1999;
Richards et al. 2000), was found in the Bosnian sam-
ple with a low frequency of 1.4%. A single haplo-
type belonging to haplogroup HV2, which is charac-
terized by HVS I motif 16217 in combination with
the site loss for 14766 MseI and 73G variant in HVS
II, was revealed in Bosnians. Note that the latter hap-
logroup, designated previously as P, was described by
Tambets et al. (2000). Both of these haplogroups appear
to be typical for southern populations of West Eurasia,

Sample codes: BOS - Bosnians; SLO - Slovenians. Mutations are shown indicating positions relative to the CRS (Anderson et al. 1981).
The nucleotide positions in HVS I and II sequences correspond to transitions; transversions are further specified. Haplogroup names
(HG) are given in capital letters according to the mtDNA classification (Macaulay et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2000). Heteroplasmic
nucleotides are indicated by a slash. The presence of insertions or deletions is indicated by .1, .2 and .3 or D, respectively, following
the nucleotide position.
because pre-HV reaches its highest frequencies in the
Near East, and HV2 extends from the West Mediter-
ranean area to India (Tambets et al. 2000). It is note-
worthy that the Bosnian HV2 sample is characterized
by the nucleotide motif 16217-16243 found previously
in Indians (Tambets et al. 2000).
Haplogroup pre-V sequences, defined by the CR
motif 16298-72 (Torroni et al. 2001), were found in
Bosnians and Slovenians at relatively high frequencies
(>6%). These samples were further identified as be-
longing to haplogroup V or paraphyletic group pre∗V
on the basis of RFLP analysis (Table 1). Those of the
pre∗V-samples defined by loss or gain of the 15904 MseI
site were designated as pre∗V1 and pre∗V2, respectively.
The present study showed that Bosnians and Slove-
nians possess pre∗V1 cluster sequences at frequencies

observed in the Mediterranean area (Torroni et al. 2001).
Results of HVS II analysis showed that Bosnian and
Slovenian V mtDNAs generally harboured the motif
72C-73A, with a single exception of 72T-73G found in
the Bosnian sample. Meanwhile, the majority of pre∗V1
HVS II sequences (4 out of 5) had the combination
72T-73A.
Table 3 summarizes frequencies of the mtDNA hap-
logroups and subgroups found in Bosnians and Slove-
nians presented here, as well as in Polish and Russian
samples studied previously (Malyarchuk et al. 2002).
All of these samples are characterized by a similar pat-
tern of mtDNA haplogroup distributions and compari-
son between populations did not reveal statistical differ-
ences (FST = −0.0018, p = 0.899). However, taking
into consideration the neighbouring Southern Euro-
pean populations, such as Albanians and Greeks (des-
ignated, according to Richards et al. (2000), as East
Mediterraneans [EMT]), Bulgarians and Romanians (as
South East Europeans [SEE]), and populations of Italy
(designated as Central Mediterraneans [CMT]), it has
been found that the populations compared produced
a very low, but significant, differentiation level (FST =
0.0058, p = 0). AMOVA results suggest that the patterns
of mtDNA diversity reflect some genetic differences be-
tween South European populations (Table 4). Signifi-
cant differences (with a p value <0.01) were observed
between populations of Italy and all Slavonic-speaking
populations. In addition, significant FST values were re-
vealed for Bosnians and East Mediterraneans. The Pol-
ish sample, representing the most northern population
of Slavs, was found to be significantly different from East
Mediterraneans as well as from South East Europeans.
The main mitochondrial haplogroup of the Bosnian
and Slovenian sequences is H, which is also the most
frequent haplogroup in Europe (Richards et al. 2000).
This haplogroup comprises the majority of the Bosnian
(48%) and Slovenian (47%) samples. It is known that
haplogroup H, according to the complete mtDNA cod-
ing region sequence, is characterized by a consider-
able branching substructure and forms at least four large

subclusters (Finnilä et al. 2001; Herrnstadt et al. 2002).
Moreover, based on mtDNA CR sequence data in
Europeans, a great number of clearly defined nucleotide
motifs was found (Richards et al. 2000; Tambets et al.
2000; Finnilä et al. 2001; Malyarchuk et al. 2002).
Among them, several subclusters, such as 16362-239,
16293-16311-195, 16162-73, 16189-16356, 16304-
16311, and 16294-16304 were found to be characteris-
tic for Germans, Poles and Russians, therefore indicating
the common genetic substratum for these Central and
Eastern European populations (Malyarchuk et al. 2002).

mtDNA haplotypes, which differ by the fewest number
of base substitutions.
Importantly, almost all of the HVS I subclusters ob-
served in Bosnians and Slovenians, (both or separately)
can be accounted for in many European populations.
Bosnians and Slovenians share, albeit at low frequency,
an H-subcluster determined by HVS I motif 16221,
which is also characteristic for other South European
populations, with the highest frequency of 2% found
in Albanians and Greeks (Richards et al. 2000). How-
ever, Bosnians and Slovenians show considerable differ-
ences in frequencies of subclusters 16162, 16189-16356,
16354 and 16362. Subcluster 16362, relatively frequent

Eastern European populations (especially in Russians),
was not observed in Slovenians. Similarly, subclus-
ter 16189-16356, which is present in all European
populations analyzed, was not found in Slovenians. On
the contrary, Slovenians have a high frequency (4.8%) of
subcluster 16162, which is characteristic for Central and

and Finns), but seems not to be typical for Southern
Europeans, including Bosnians. However, the western
neighbors of Slovenians, Veneto-speaking Italians from
Barco and Posina, possess this H-subcluster at a high
frequency of about 6% (Mogentale-Profizi et al. 2001).
It should be noted, however, that Italian Veneti differ
greatly from Slovenians by an increased frequency of
the haplogroup TJ (35% on average; Mogentale-Profizi
et al. 2001).
The H-subcluster, determined by motif 16293-
16311 that is characterized by a pan-European dis-
tribution (Richards & Macaulay, 2000), was found
both in Bosnians and Slovenians. However, its Eastern
European branch 16278-16293-16311, frequent in
Russians and Finns, occurred only in Bosnians. The
member of another branch, 16092-16293-16311, was
observed only in Slovenians - this sequence type (16092-
16140-16265-16293-16311) is identical to those char-
acteristic for Poles (Malyarchuk et al. 2002). As sequence
type belonging to subgroup 16304-16311, which is
present in Russians, Poles and South Germans, was
found in the Slovenian sample, whereas another rare
H-branch defined by motif 16294-16304 was found in
both Bosnians and Slovenians.
It is well known that European populations contain
a large number of closely related mtDNA lineages, and
geographic patterns of mtDNA variations may exist at
the level of individual lineages (Helgason et al. 2000;
Richards et al. 2000). Therefore, analysis of the distri-
bution of rare mtDNA lineages and their combinations
in populations may be an informative tool for study-
ing ethnic history. For example, H-haplotype 16223
revealed in the mtDNA pool of Slovenians is present
in European populations being found in South Ger-
mans and Ukrainians (Lutz et al. 1998; Malyarchuk &
Derenko, 2001). Rare H-haplotype 16263, found in
Slovenians, has so far been observed only in Germans
(Table 5) and in French-speaking populations (Rousselet
& Mangin, 1998; Dimo-Simonin et al. 2000). Besides
the H-sequences, there are also several geographically
informative J- and U5-sequence types. Sequence type
16069-16126-16366 and its derivatives occurred at no-
ticeable frequencies in Bosnians and Germans as well as
in Poles and Russians. Another J∗-subcluster, defined by
HVS I motif 16069-16126-16261 (with J∗-HVS II mo-
tif 185-228), was found at low frequency both in Bosni-
ans and Slovenians, but is present at surprisingly high fre-
quency in Southern European populations, with a peak
(>5%) in Greeks and Albanians (Richards et al. 2000).
Similarly, the J∗-HVS I sequence type 16069-16126 was
found in more than 7% of Slovenians, as well as Albani-
ans and Greeks. This frequency is 10 times higher than
the corresponding value in Bosnians and essentially ex-
ceeds frequencies observed in different European pop-
ulations, according to the database of Richards et al.
(2000). Interestingly, this 16069-16126 HVS I sequence
type, revealed in 8 out of 104 Slovenians, appears to be
very diverse, being found in association with 7 different
HVS II sequences. Since, in Europe, haplogroup J ap-
pears to have arrived from the Near East in the Neolithic
period (Richards et al. 1998, 2000), the high levels of
the root type 16069-16126 found in Slovenians possibly
may represent a traces of the Neolithic migrations from
the Near East.
Distribution of other mtDNA lineages seems to re-
flect the historical contacts between populations of the
Northwestern Balkans and Northern/Eastern Europe.
The U5b1-lineage with motif 16144-16189-16270 oc-
curs at a frequency of 1.4% in Bosnians, but it is well
known that this U5-subcluster has a restricted North-
ern/Eastern European distribution, being found fre-
quently (8%–52%) in Finns and Saami as well as rarely
(0.5%–1.5%) in Slavonic (Russians and Poles) and Baltic
(Lithuanians) populations (Sajantila et al. 1995; Orekhov
et al. 1999; Meinilä et al. 2001; Kasperaviciute &
Kucinskas, 2002; Malyarchuk et al. 2002). In addi-
tion, Bosnians are characterized by the presence of the
Asian-specific haplogroup Z (0.7%), which was previ-
ously revealed in Europe in Saami, Finns and Russians
(Sajantila et al. 1995; Delghandi et al. 1998; Orekhov
et al. 1999; Malyarchuk & Derenko, 2001; Meinilä et al.
2001). In Slovenians, the U5a-lineage defined by the
substitution 16114A was found at a relatively high fre-
quency of 3.8%. To date, this lineage that has been
C© University College London 2003 Annals of Human Genetics (2003) 67,412–425 421
B. A. Malyarchuk et al.
found with a similarly high frequency only in Finns
(Meinilä et al. 2001). In addition, Slovenians are char-
acterized by the presence of another lineage frequently
occurring in Finns – the U5b-haplotype 16192-16311
(Table 5).
The mitochondrial gene pool of Bosnians has some
peculiarities, clearly distinguishing this population from
Slovenians. Among them, there is a high frequency of
an H-sequence type that differs from the CRS-HVS I
only at the position 16311. Although 11 Bosnians (7.6%)
carry this HVS I sequence type (which is, neverthe-
less, characterized by 6 different HVS II sequences), it
has, to date, been found with a similar frequency (6%)
only in the Alpine region, according to the database of
Richards et al. (2000). Another mtDNA haplotype fre-
quent in Bosnians (2.8%) is a sequence type with CR
motif 16189-153-204. The results of screening for this
H-subgroup in published HVS I and II data sets from dif-
ferent European populations demonstrate that only one
such haplotype has been found in the Austrian popu-
lation (according to data of Parson et al. 1998). Mean-
while, H-16189 sequences are widespread in Europe,
but almost all of them do not carry the specific nu-
cleotide combination 153-204 in HVS II. For instance,
6.5% of Finns have HVS I sequence type 16093-16189
or simply 16189, but all of these sequences do not have
any specific HVS II motifs (Finnilä et al. 2001; Meinilä
et al. 2001). However, one cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that the “Bosnian-specific” H-16189 subclus-
ter is present in the Eastern Mediterranean region, as
well as in Southeastern Europe (among Bulgarians and
Romanians), since these populations are characterized
by 4% of H-16189 sequences according to the HVS
I database of Richards et al. (2000). Therefore, addi-
tional studies on HVS I and II variability are required
to clarify this question. In addition, in Bosnians CR
sequences have been found (at a frequency of 1.4%)
belonging to haplogroup H and having HVS II mo-
tif 055-057, which is very rare in Europe, being previ-
ously observed only in Icelanders (Helgason et al. 2000).
There is also a considerable difference between sub-
cluster U5b sequences present in Bosnians and Slove-
nians, since all Bosnian U5b members (4.9%) are de-
fined by the 16189-16270 motif, whereas in Slovenians,
two out of three U5b-sequences belong to the specific
branch determined by a possible back mutation from
T to C at the U5-diagnostic position 16270 (Meinilä
et al. 2001).
In summary, this study reveals that the genetic pool
of Bosnians has more similarities with other Southern
European populations - the presence of typically South
European mtDNA haplogroups, such as pre-HV, HV2
and U1 (Richards et al. 2000), and even one African-
specific L1b sequence, which is observed, nevertheless,
at low frequencies in Southern Italy (Rickards et al.
2000). Meanwhile, other examples presented here show
that Bosnians and Slovenians possess interesting com-
binations of mtDNA subclusters and separate CR se-
quence types, characteristic mostly of Central and East-
ern Europeans. This suggests that the common genetic
substratum observed in modern German, Slavonic and
western Finno-Ugric populations also penetrates also
South East European populations, reaching territory as
far as the Western Balkans. Meanwhile, genetic evi-
dence concerning observed differentiation of Bosnians
and Slovenians at the level of mtDNA subclusters may
suggests that different groups of the Slavs penetrated
the Balkans during their move to the south. Accord-
ing to archaeological data, the Slavs invaded the Balkan
Peninsula as early as the 2nd century A.D., but af-
ter the 5th century A.D. large Slavonic movements
came from two directions into the Balkans: from the
east over the Carpathian Mountains and also from
the north across Pannonia into the Western Balkans
(Sedov, 1979; Šavli et al. 1996). The observed simi-
larity between Bosnian and Russian/Finnish mtDNAs
(such as U5b1, Z, H-16354, H-16278-16293-16311),
and Slovenian and German/Polish/Finnish mtDNAs
(such as H-16162, H-16263, U5b-16192-16311, U5a-
16114A) allows us to speculate that the differences be-
tween the Slovenian and Bosnian mtDNA pools may
have been partially due to the two different Slavonic
migration waves that reached the Balkans in the early
Middle Ages from different regions of Europe. It is
noteworthy that Slavonic-speaking populations (Poles,
Russians, Belorussians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Slovaks) are
characterized by a high frequency (30%–50%) of Y
chromosome haplogroups, defined by the M17 marker
(Malaspina et al. 2000; Rosser et al. 2000; Semino
et al. 2000). This haplogroup, R1a according to the
Y Chromosome Consortium (2002), is rare in West-
ern and Southern Europe, including Greeks (8%–21%),
422 Annals of Human Genetics (2003) 67,412–425 C© University College London 2003
Bosnian and Slovenian mtDNAs
Albanians (10%–12%), Italians (2%–4%), but notably it is
present in Slavonic-speaking populations of the Balkan
Peninsula, being found at a relatively high frequency in
Croats (29.3%), Slovenians (37.0%) and Macedonians
(35.0%), with the possible exception of Bulgarians (12%)
(Malaspina et al. 2000; Rosser et al. 2000; Semino et al.
2000). This high level of the haplogroup R1a in the
majority of the Southern Slavs appears to be a good in-
dicator of the genetic impact of the expanding Slavonic
waves in past times. A more extended Y chromosome
microsatellite analysis of R1a haplotypes in the Slavonic
populations is currently underway, to clarify the com-
plex pattern of population expansions in the Balkan
area.
