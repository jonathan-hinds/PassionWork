ABSTRACT
This paper assesses the content- and population-dynamics of a large
sample of wikis, over a timespan of several months, in order to
identify basic features that may predict or induce different types
of fate. We analyze and discuss, in particular, the correlation of
various macroscopic indicators, structural features and governance
policies with specific growth patterns. While recent analyses of
wiki dynamics have mostly focused on popular projects such as
Wikipedia, we suggest research directions towards a more general
theory of the dynamics of such communities.

1. INTRODUCTION
Mapping the wikisphere
Online communities have demonstrated their potential to leverage
a vast amount of collaboratively contributed content. Famous ex-
amples include large open-source software development projects
such as Mozilla Firefox or Linux [5] and wiki-based encyclopedias

such as Wikipedia [4]. However not all projects achieve such suc-
cessful outcomes. Their destiny relies on the capacity of project
maintainers to attract new members, to develop policies to secure
contributors’ commitment, and to promote high standards.
The question of forging a sustainable community of active con-
tributors is particularly crucial for individuals, companies and orga-
nizations willing to launch and develop wiki-based projects. This
issue relates more broadly to the understanding of the general dy-
namics of content-based communities and, therefore, calls for re-
search on a wide range of wikis at various stages of development.
Previous studies have mainly focused on Wikipedia. While of great
interest, it seems difficult to build on this knowledge to develop
a more comprehensive theory of the social structure and content
dynamics of wikis—Wikipedia is a special case in many respects
(population, maturity, topical range, and media attention, among
other indicators). A comprehensive analysis of wiki dynamics is
further hindered by the heterogeneity of wiki platforms and by the
lack of tools and methods to collect data in a standardized way.
Nevertheless, a first approach to generalisation can be achieved by
examining a set of wikis that share the same platform.
In the following sections, we present an analysis of the evolution
of a large sample of wikis based on the MediaWiki engine. In par-
ticular, we investigate some indicators that correlate with different
growth rates, as a preliminary step towards a full-fledged under-
standing of factors that determine different patterns of evolution.
Wiki ecology: demographics and viability
The literature on the dynamics of Web-based communities is rel-
atively scarce [6, 9] and, to our knowledge, the present study rep-
resents the first longitudinal analysis of the content and popula-
tion dynamics of a large set of wikis over time using data retrieved
via an API-based service. As well as almost always focusing on
Wikipedia, previous quantitative wiki research has mainly exam-
ined the topological structure of underlying interaction or hyperlink
networks [3, 12] or article-level features [1, 11], with little interest
in the specific dynamics of the demographic determinants them-
selves (with the exception of [8] which investigates Wikipedia’s
demographics of casual vs. committed contributors). In a previous
study of a static dataset describing wikis we provided a glimpse of
the demographic structure of a portion of the wikisphere in terms
of both population and content sizes, but stopped short of investi-
gating its evolution.[10]
As content-based online communities, wikis most significantly
vary in two dimensions: (i) contributors, who may or may not con-
stitute an active community (as described e.g. in [2]); and (ii) pages,
which may or may not amount to authoritative or useful content (as
demonstrated for example by [4]). Users and pages are likely to
obey a dual dynamic: while more users may contribute to more
pages, content proliferation in turn seems to require more attention
from users. As a first approximation, it may thus seem judicious
to assess the healthiness of a wiki through these variables, taken as
demographic proxies for its actual growth and activity.1
2. EMPIRICAL PROTOCOL
2.1 Dataset
We constructed a dataset made of simple statistics gathered for
a large number of MediaWiki-based wikis,2 which enabled us to
consider the same set of variables across all wikis and make sure
these variables were generally available. The data was collected
over the period August 2007–April 2008 from a publicly-available
database3 totaling 11 500+ wikis.
2.2 Variables
We considered a set of four quantitative variables:
• population size (U ), measured by the number of registered
users;
• content size (P ), measured by the number of so-called “good”
pages, hereafter indifferently called “pages”, “good pages”
or “articles” ;
• administrator population (A), or the number of users who
are granted “administrator status”, i.e. special rights to mod-
ify sensitive content and perform maintenance activity;
• editing activity (E), measured by the total number of edits;
as well as one qualitative variable related to the presence of an op-
tional access control mechanism:4
• editing permission (R), or editing access control, i.e. the pos-
sibility of creating a page for unregistered/anonymous users.
R ∈ {0, 1}, where 1 ≡ “anonymous editing allowed”.
These variables provide simplistic yet key indicators of the global
dynamics of a wiki, and shed light on diverse aspects of its struc-
ture and evolution. We collected the values of these variables for
each wiki on a daily basis and over a period of 250 days, i.e. ap-
proximatively 8 months.
2.3 Scope restrictions
Platform exclusions
A large number of wikis in the database are based on wikifarms, i.e.
platforms hosting several wikis and providing services easing wiki
creation and management. Some of these platforms return system-
wide rather than wiki-specific figures when queried for wiki statis-
tics, resulting in spurious data. To avoid this, all wikis explicitly
hosted on platforms exhibiting this behavior (such as wikis hosted
on wikia.com) were excluded from the dataset.
1It should be noted however that raw content growth per se may not be a good indica-
tor of a sustainable wiki, as studies on wiki proliferation seem to suggest. [7]
2This initial dataset includes among others a large set of Wikipedias.
3Available from http://s23.org. The database is maintained by a user called
“Mutante” who graciously granted us the permission to automatically harvest this data.
4This indicator was not part of the original dataset. To obtain this specific information
we crawled each wiki in the dataset, at the beginning of the study, using a robot that
attempted to determine whether page creation was possible without prior user regis-
tration.
Population range
In [10] we observed, on a similar but static dataset, that a large
majority of wikis are both thinly populated (i.e. often less than 10
users) and/or do not have a significant number of pages (i.e. gener-
ally less than 10 pages). In the present study, in order to focus on
a relatively homogeneous wiki population, we excluded both wikis
with very large populations and those with very few users, so as
to avoid basing the analysis on data spanning too many orders of
magnitude in terms of population. Included in the dataset, there-
fore, were only wikis whose user population was within the range
[400, 20 000] on the first day of data collection (note that in this
region, content sizes are widely spread, from a few to hundreds of
thousands of pages).
Growth discontinuities
Some wikis experience abrupt changes of one or even several or-
ders of magnitude in population or content size. There are many
possible causes of such changes, including spam attacks, and ad-
ministrative decisions to transfer, create, merge or suppress pages
in bulk or admit or expel classes of user.5 To exclude wikis ex-
hibiting such a “suspicious” behavior, on the assumption that no
recruitment of users or creation of pages of a significant magni-
tude could “naturally” happen within a period as short as 24 hours,
a threshold percentage of change α between two successive days,
for both population and content sizes, was set. Wikis whose daily
growth in either content or users was above the threshold were ex-
cluded from the dataset. α was set to 0.05, i.e. wikis were excluded
if they had ever experienced more than a 5% increase or decrease
in users or pages over a period of 24 hours.
Clean dataset
To sum up, the final, “clean” dataset is thus made up of about
360 wikis, all of which have an initial population between 400 and
20 000 users, are not hosted by ‘wiki farms’ that do not report use-
ful data, and which have no major discontinuity in the daily change
of their population or content.
3. WIKI DYNAMICS
We assessed wiki dynamics by comparing their diverse paths with
respect to a set of independent variables. ‘Growth’ is defined in
terms of population and content size change: user growthGU (resp.
page growth GP ) is the ratio between final and initial populations
(resp. content sizes): GU = Ulast/Ufirst (resp. GP = Plast/Pfirst).
Wiki dynamics were studied as a function of the variables listed in
Section 2.2:
(i) DESCRIPTIVE INDICATORS, i.e. variables on which wiki ad-
ministrators have no direct control: (a) user activity, i.e. the
proportion of edits per user (E/U ), (b) user density, i.e. the
proportion of users per page (U/P ), and (c) editing density,
i.e. the proportion of edits per page (E/P ).
(ii) GOVERNANCE FACTORS, variables that wiki administrators
can directly control: (a) administration ratio, i.e. the propor-
tion of users who are granted administrator status (A/U ), (b)
administration density, i.e. the proportion of administrators
per page (A/P ), (c) editing permission (R).
5We acknowledge that cases of spam attack are evidence that wiki sustainability is
already highly damaged. However, without a method for systematically distinguishing
these cases we prefer to leave aside this portion of the dataset for the sake of the present
analysis.

Table 1: Quantile boundaries and sets
For each continuous variable, instead of carrying out a delicate
analysis by dealing with clouds of points, we adopted a more in-
sightful approach by dividing wikis into five quantiles, each includ-
ing exactly 20% of all wikis in the clean dataset (see Table 1). We
then computed and compared growth ratio means over all wikis for
each quantile. Additionally, we distinguished population quantiles
in order to control for user size-related effects. To this end, we
plotted a growth landscape that consists of a two-dimensional rep-
resentation of the various growth ratios. This representation was
applied to all the above-mentioned variables, except for R where
there are only two “quantiles” (0 or 1). For each variable except R,
the upper graphs indicate the mean values and confidence intervals
(p < 0.05) of each quantile on the variable considered, while the
lower graphs show contour plots for the same variable with brighter
areas corresponding to higher growth ratios.

3.1 Significant descriptive indicators
We found significant correlations between a number of descriptive
indicators of wiki structure and their content and population growth
rates. Figure 1 shows the effect of user activity (measured as the
proportion of edits per user) on growth rates. The results suggest
that user activity correlates very strongly with wiki growth, not only
in terms of content production (which is to a certain extent unsur-
prising) but also new member recruitment. The effect becomes
stronger with initially more populated wikis: the more users are
actively editing, the more a wiki grows in content and population.
Figure 2 shows the impact of user density on growth. The results
suggest that a higher number of contributors per page does not nec-
essarily indicate mushrooming wikis: for an identical content size,
we found a significant correlation between a lower number of users
and higher growth ratios, both in content and new members.

Figure 2: Growth landscape with respect to the proportion of

To better visualize the effect of user density on growth, we rep-
resented the dependent variables GU and GP , independent vari-
able U/P , and initial wiki positions Ufirst and Pfirst altogether on
the same graph, yielding a phase diagram as plotted on Fig. 3.6 In
this diagram, each dot (light color) corresponds to a wiki in the
database. Each arrow corresponds to a pair of quantiles “users per
page, population”. Widths and heights are proportional to user and
content growth ratios, respectively. The size of the arrow represents
the strength of the observed growth in content and population for
wikis in a given region of the wikisphere.
This graph should be regarded as a map of a portion of the wiki-
sphere, showing the expected destiny of a wiki in terms of content
and population growth as a function of its initial position in the
same space. This diagram broadly suggests that a wiki’s position
is correlated with its subsequent fate. More precisely, it illustrates
that wikis in the upper/upper-right portion of the diagram are grow-
ing faster, and more interestingly it provides an overview of demo-
graphic dynamics in this region of the wikisphere.
3.2 Effective governance factors
Turning to governance features, we first analyzed the effects of
the administrator population on wiki dynamics by looking at the
overall proportion of administrators per page.
Figure 4 shows that having a relatively high number of adminis-
trators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth. There is a
strong effect of the proportion of admins per page both on user and
page growth. For instance, while the last quantile of admins/page
ratio enjoys near-zero growth rates over 8 months, the first quantile
tops overall rates (∼+50% for users, ∼+25% for pages). This ef-

fect may be interpreted as the impact of strong governance activity
on the proliferation of content and users.
We identified another significant effect when we considered edit-
ing permission. As a binary variable, the editing permission vari-
able generates only two groups of wikis (wikis that allow anony-
mous editing versus wikis that restrict editing to registered users
only). The growth landscape is consequently limited to a one-
dimensional comparison over population quantiles. The results in
Figure 5 show that for both dimensions—population and content—
having no access control is likely to favour growth. While a stronger
page growth is quite unsurprising in wikis where no registration is
required, the fact that this factor also fuels user registration is more

that wikis with unrestricted registration seem to trigger participa-

Finally, we consider two indicators that showed a markedly milder
correlation with wiki dynamics.
On the one hand, we found that editing density (i.e. edits/page)
correlates negatively with user growth in a moderate way—with
a relatively stronger effect depending on initial population size—
while there is surprisingly no significant correlation with page growth
(Figure 6).
On the other hand, higher administration ratios (i.e. admins/user)
have no significant effect on content or population growth, as evi-
denced by the contour plot on Figure 7.
3.4 Summary of findings
The results of this preliminary analysis suggest that different struc-
tural and goverance-related factors have a significant effect on the
dynamics of wikis, both in terms of content and population growth.
Figure 8 summarizes the correlations found between growth ratios
and each of the variables we considered, by comparing the gain in
the population and content sizes between the last and the first quan-
tile for each variable (variables are ranked from the most positively
to the most negatively correlated). Some indicators
As far as governance factors are concerned, we observed that
population growth is more than 20% larger for anonymously ed-
itable wikis. With respect to administration policies, while too
many administrators per page may hinder the growth of a wiki (in
terms of content size), the proportion of administrators per user

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The main contribution of this study is an overview of which indica-
tors wiki communities should take into account in order to control
their demographics, by paying specific attention to some variables
and consider acting upon them when possible, while neglecting
others. In this respect, we drew attention to the remarkable dy-
namical intertwinement of population and content growth, which
suggests that models of wiki dynamics will probably need to focus
on the strong interrelations between these two variables.
Representing the impact of specific variables via phase diagrams
can be a valuable solution for wiki administrators for monitoring
purposes and for social scientists as a first step towards modeling.
However, in order to develop more accurate models of wiki dy-
namics, richer datasets with more detailed indicators and platform-
independent data collection tools need to be developed. In order
to make the data tractable for this initial analysis, we restricted the
dataset in several ways and a more comprehensive study, beyond
the scope of the present paper, should endeavor to investigate a
larger spectrum of wiki-based communities.
