Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation was examined in Poles (from the Pomerania-
Kujawy region; n¯ 436) and Russians (from three different regions of the European part of Russia;
n¯ 201), for which the two hypervariable segments (HVS I and HVS II) and haplogroup-specific
coding region sites were analyzed. The use of mtDNA coding region RFLP analysis made it possible
to distinguish parallel mutations that occurred at particular sites in the HVS I and II regions during
mtDNA evolution. In total, parallel mutations were identified at 73 nucleotide sites in HVS I
(17±8%) and 31 sites in HVS II (7±73%). The classification of mitochondrial haplotypes revealed the
presence of all major European haplogroups, which were characterized by similar patterns of
distribution in Poles and Russians. An analysis of the distribution of the control region haplotypes
did not reveal any specific combinations of unique mtDNA haplotypes and their subclusters that
clearly distinguish both Poles and Russians from the neighbouring European populations. The only
exception is a novel subcluster U4a within subhaplogroup U4, defined by a diagnostic mutation at
nucleotide position 310 in HVS II. This subcluster was found in common predominantly between
Poles and Russians (at a frequency of 2±3% and 2±0%, respectively) and may therefore have a
central-eastern European origin.

Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
polymorphism has become a useful tool for
human population and molecular evolution
studies, allowing researchers to infer the pattern
of female migrations and peopling of different
regions of the world (Wallace, 1995). The use of
the phylogeographic approach has allowed refine-
ment of the analysis of maternal mtDNA
lineages, suggesting the current model of com-
plex demographic scenarios for European
peopling (Richards et al. 2000). Although linguis-

Slavonic populations living in Europe, there are
many unanswered questions about the origin and
dispersal of Slavs.
Archaeological studies indicate that the
Lusatian culture (1300 to 1100 B.C.) emerged in
central Europe, and later spread over a region
that reached from the central basin of the Oder
River and the Bohemian mountain ridge, as far
east as the Ukraine, and as far north as the
shores of the Baltic Sea (Sedov, 1979; SC avli et al.
1996). Despite the divergent views on the ethnic
affiliation of the Lusatian culture, it is often
considered that this culture constituted the
foundation of the historical development of the
Proto-Slavs (SC avli et al. 1996). According to
linguistic data, the split among Proto-Slavs, the
bearers of the Lusatian culture, resulted in the
three Slavonic language groups – Western, East-
262 B. A. M  
ern and Southern (SC avli et al. 1996). In the north,
the Lusatian culture was succeeded by the
Pomeranian culture, extending over the coastal
region from the mouth of the Oder to the mouth
of the Vistula. The Przeworsk group encom-
passed the southern parts of present-day Poland.
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., this group
spread northward into the swampy Pripet and
united there with the Zarubincy culture. It has
been suggested that out of this culture the
Eastern Slavonic language group developed
(Rybakov, 1981; SC avli et al. 1996). Archae-
ologists report that the Slavs invaded the Balkan
peninsula as early as the 2nd century A.D., and
since this settlement movement of the Southern
Slavs gradually evolved (Sedov, 1979). All of
these ‘migration’ hypotheses claim that modern
Slavonic groups are the result of an admixture
between pre-Slavonic European populations and
Slavonic tribes, whose homeland was probably in
central Europe (Sedov, 1979; Alekseeva &
Alekseev, 1989). This theory also predicts that
diverse modern Slavonic populations may have
certain combinations of genetic markers derived
from the gene pool of the assumed ancestral
Proto-Slavonic population.
A high-resolution analysis of maternal mtDNA
lineages appears to be a highly informative
approach in the reconstruction of the past
demographic events, when large enough samples
are available (Helgason et al. 2000). MtDNA
sequences can be used to create a detailed pattern
of the spatially resolved distribution of maternal
lineages in Slavonic populations, and to trace a
number of shared maternal lineages unique for
Slavonic groups, connecting them among them-
selves and to other neighbours such as present-
day German and Finno-Ugric populations.
However, the mtDNA data sets for Slavonic
populations living in Southern, Central, and
Eastern Europe are either incomplete or virtually
non-existent for many regional groups of Slavs,
especially for populations inhabiting the East
European Plain. Population samples of Slavs
have been analyzed in different ways: some
covering only HVS I sequences, others also
including coding-region RFLPs (Malyarchuk et
al. 1995; Calafell et al. 1996; Orekhov et al. 1999;
Richards et al. 2000; Tolk et al. 2000; Malyarchuk
& Derenko, 2001). In addition, almost all of these
mtDNA studies have not addressed specific
questions about the origin and early dispersal of
Slavs in Europe. To date, it is known that
Slavonic populations sharing the same language
group (such as Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians)
display a large amount of interpopulation genetic
variation (Malyarchuk & Derenko, 2001). More-
over, we have not found any specific combi-
nations of unique mtDNA types that clearly
distinguish Russians from Germans and the
neighboring Eastern European populations.
To obtain a better characterization of Slavonic
mtDNA variability, we present here mtDNA
diversity data in Poles and Russians, based on
the HVS I and HVS II sequences typed for the
presence of major West Eurasian haplogroup-
specific markers.

Population samples
A population sample of 436 Poles from the
Pomerania-Kujawy region of the northern part
of Poland was studied. In addition, three popu-
lation samples of Russians from the European
region of Russia were analysed: 62 unrelated
individuals from the south (Stavropol region), 76
from the centre (Orel region) and 63 from the
east (Saratov region).
MtDNA analysis
DNA samples from the blood of individuals
studied were used for mtDNA amplification and
sequencing. PCR amplification of the entire
noncoding region was performed using the
primers L15926 and H00580. The temperature
profile for 30 cycles of amplification was 94 °C for
20 sec, 50 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 2±5 min
(Thermal Cycler 9700; Perkin Elmer, USA). The
resulting amplification product was diluted 1000-
fold and 4 µl aliquots were added to an array of
second-round, nested PCR reactions (32 cycles)
to generate DNA templates for sequencing. The
primer sets L15997}M13(®21)H16401 and
M13(®21)L15997}H16401 were used to generate
Polish and Russian MtDNAs 263
both strands of the hypervariable segment I
(HVS I). Similarly, the primer sets L00029}M13-
(®21)H00408 and H00408}M13(®21)L00029
were used for hypervariable segment II (HVS II).
Both primer sequences, and nomenclature, were
used according to Sullivan et al. (1992).
Negative controls were prepared for both the
DNA extraction and the amplification process.
PCR products were purified by ultrafiltration
(Microcon 100; Amicon) and sequenced directly
from both strands with the (®21)M13 primer
using the BigDye Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Sequencing products were separated in
a 4% PAGE gel on the ABI PrismTM 377
DNA Sequencer. Data were analyzed using DNA
Sequencing Analysis and Sequence Navigator
programs (Perkin Elmer). The nucleotide se-
quences obtained were compared with the
Cambridge reference sequence (CRS; Anderson
et al. 1981).
To determine the haplogroup status of the
control region (CR) sequences, RFLP typing was
performed by restriction endonuclease analysis
of PCR amplified mtDNA fragments using the
same primer pairs and amplification conditions
as described by Torroni et al. (1996, 1997),
Macaulay et al. (1999), and Finnila$ et al. (2000).
The samples were typed for a restricted set of
RFLPs that were diagnostic of all major western
Eurasian clusters, on the basis of the hierarchical
mtDNA RFLP scheme (Macaulay et al. 1999).
To determine haplogroup H sequences, all
samples were tested for 14766MseI, 10394DdeI,
and 7025AluI. Samples lacking these three sites
were assigned to cluster H. All non-H samples
harboring ®14766MseI and ®10394DdeI were
tested for 15904MseI, and samples with
­15904MseI site were classified as cluster pre-V,
which is solely defined by the two CR mutations
16298C and 72C (Torroni et al. 2001). All non-H
and non-pre-V samples (®14766MseI and
®10394DdeI) were determined as HV*.
All non-HV samples were tested for
12308HinfI. Those with ­12308HinfI were
assigned to clusters U and K, and were further
determined as belonging to haplogroup K or to
subgroups of the haplogroup U on the basis of
the HVS I motif information (Richards et al.
1998; Macaulay et al. 1999). The phylogenetic
status of subhaplogroup U4 was determined by
RFLP screening of the 4643RsaI site (Macaulay
et al. 1999).
The remaining samples were tested for
13366BamHI, 15606AluI, 15925MspI, and
12629AvaII. Those with ­13366BamHI,
­15606AluI, and ®15925MspI were assigned to
cluster T. The haplogroup T sequences lacking
the 12629AvaII site were classified as T1, whereas
those with ­12629AvaII were declared as T*.
The remaining samples were tested for
13704BstOI, and those with ®13704BstOI and
­10394DdeI were classified as J.
Further, mtDNAs were classified as follows:
­14465AccI to cluster X; ®4529HaeII, ­8249-
AvaII, ­16389BamHI, and ­10032AluI to clus-
ter I; ­8249 AvaII and ®8994HaeIII to cluster
W; ­10394DdeI and ­10397AluI to cluster M.
M-sequences were further classified as belonging
to haplogroup C (®13259HincII, ­13262AluI),
D (®5176AluI), E (®7598HhaI), or G
(­4830HaeII, ­4831HhaI). The remaining con-
trol region sequences were assigned to certain
haplogroups (such as R*, N1b, N1c, L3, pre-HV)
on the basis of the HVS I motifs classification
(Macaulay et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2000).
Sequence classification into subhaplogroups was
based on the HVS I motifs and nomenclature of
Richards et al. (1998, 2000) and Macaulay et al.
(1999).
Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analysis, all available pub-
lished data on HVS I-RFLP mtDNA variability
in West Eurasian populations were used
(Richards et al. 2000). To classify the Slavonic
mtDNA haplotype diversity, a phylogeographic
approach, based on the phylogenetic analysis of
the spatial distribution of mitochondrial haplo-
types and haplogroups determined as a mono-
phyletic clade, was performed (Richards et al.
1998). The phylogenetic relationships between
mitochondrial haplotypes comprising various
combinations of the HVS I and HVS II sequences
and RFLPs were analyzed by the median-
network method (Bandelt et al. 1995). To es-
264 B. A. M  
timate the diversity of mtDNA haplotypes, the
average number of transitions on the recon-
structed phylogeny from ancestral type to each
sample (ρ) was used, according to the methods of
Forster et al. (1996).
For the CR sequence sharing analysis, HVS I
and HVS II haplotypes of Poles and Russians, as
well as other European populations, were com-
pared. Data from the following populations were
used: 200 Southern Germans (Lutz et al. 1998) ;
101 Austrians (Parson et al. 1998) ; 150 Western
Germans (Baasner et al. 1998; Baasner & Madea,
2000) ; 109 North-Western Germans (Pfeiffer et
al. 1999) ; and 192 Finns (Finnila$ et al. 2001b).

Sequence variability in Poles and Russians
In the present study, the nucleotide sequences
of HVS I from position 15991 to 16400 and HVS
II from position 20 to 420 have been determined
in 436 Poles and 201 Russians. Comparison to
the Cambridge reference sequence (Anderson et
al. 1981) showed that 140 nucleotide sites were
polymorphic in HVS I (34±2%) and 79 sites in
HVS II (19±7%). Transitions and transversions
were found at 136 nps in HVS I and at 73 nps in
HVS II. For each hypervariable region, tran-
sitions predominate over transversions, being
found with a ratio of 133:16 and 73:0 in HVS I
and HVS II, respectively. Among the transitions,
pyrimidine substitutions were observed with
significantly higher frequency in HVS I (with a
pyrimidine:purine ratio of 92:41), whereas in
HVS II the pyrimidine:purine ratio was 42:31.
Among the transversions in HVS I there is no
predominating type: C!A transversions were
found at 5 nps, A!C at 4 nps, C!G at 3 nps,
AUT at 3 nps and G!C at one nucleotide
position. It is interesting that multiple substi-
tutions were found at 9 positions of HVS I – from
C to T and A at np 16111; from C to T and A at
np 16114; from G to A and C at np 16129; from
C to T and G at np 16176; from C to T, G and A
at np 16188; from C to T and G at np 16239; from
A to G and T at np 16241; from A to G and C at
np 16258; and from A to G, T and C at np 16318.
Point deletion and insertion events were
observed both in HVS I and HVS II. In HVS I
an insertion polymorphism was found at np
16193. The occurrence of such a type of poly-
morphism is probably due to instability in the
homopolymeric tract between nps 16184 and
16193, which can be associated with a transition
from T to C at np 16189 (Bendall & Sykes, 1995).
Similarly, length polymorphism in the poly-C
tract of HVS II at nps 303–315 was found in the
majority of the mtDNA samples studied. In this
tract, insertions of either one, two (at nps 309
and 315), or three (at np 309) C-residues were
identified. In addition, insertions of single nucleo-
tides were observed at nps 42 (­T), 60 (­T), 270
(­A) and 299 (­C). Deletions of nucleotides in
the mtDNA control region appear to be rarer
events, and they were found at nps 16073 (®C)
and 16078 (®A) in HVS I, and at nps 249 (®A)
and 315 (®C) in HVS II.
Heteroplasmic positions were clearly detected
in four instances at nps 16093, 16231, 16325 and
72. The heteroplasmic status of these positions
was confirmed several times by sequencing of
both mtDNA strands.
The use of RFLP analysis for mtDNA coding
regions amplified via PCR has allowed us to
determine the exact phylogenetic status of HVS
I and II sequences and distinguish independent
(parallel) mutations occurring at particular sites
during the evolution mtDNA lineages (Macaulay
et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2000; Finnila$ et al.
2001b ; Malyarchuk & Derenko, 2001). As a
result, we have identified a total of 73 hyper-
variable sites in HVS I (17±8%) and 31 hyper-
variable sites in HVS II (7±73%) at which more
than one independent mutation is observed
(Tables 1 and 2). However, in HVS II the
number of parallel mutations is approximately
1±8 times as high as the corresponding HVS I
value (279 and 155, respectively). Accordingly,
the ratio of the average number of parallel
mutations per site in HVS II (5±0) and HVS I
(3±82) is 1±31. This estimate ranges from 1±17 in
Russians to 1±34 in Poles. Therefore, as was
suggested previously (Bandelt et al. 2000),
although on average HVS II seems to be less

Mutations are shown indicating positions relative to the revised CRS (Andrews et al. 1999). Haplogroup name
denotes the presence of mutation occurring in the background of this haplogroup. A numeral (n) denotes the number
of parallel mutations observed. Haplogroups, which have shared ancestry for a certain nucleotide variant, are shown
in parentheses.
variable (per position) than HVS I, the homo-
plasic events are more numerous in HVS II, but
concentrated at fewer sites – such as 146, 150,
152 and 195. These sites are at least as variable
as the most variable positions (16093, 16189,
16311 and 16362) in HVS I.
The HVS I and HVS II regions differ slightly
in the number of pyrimidine transitions at
hypervariable sites, with a higher pyrimidine:
purine ratio being found in HVS I (3±33 in total
sample, 3±65 in Poles and 4±8 in Russians) in
comparison with values for HVS II (2±52 in total
sample, 2±68 in Poles and 2±63 in Russians).
The molecular instability of the poly-
pyrimidine tract (C5)-T-(C4) located between
nps 16184 and 16193 of the L-strand is one of the
most studied manifestations of mtDNA hyper-
variability. It was found that a transition from T
to C at np 16189 results in a continuous poly-C
tract which may vary in length from 8 to 14
nucleotides (Bendall & Sykes, 1995; Marchington
et al. 1996). Table 3 shows examples of variation
in the tract length found in Polish and Russian
mtDNAs. Another example of a hypervariable
polypyrimidine sequence is a (C7)-T-(C5) tract
starting at np 303 in HVS II. In comparison with
the CRS (Anderson et al. 1981), insertion of an
additional C residue at np 315 is common in Poles
and Russians as well as in other population
groups studied (Budowle et al. 1999). It is well
established that both poly-C portions in this
tract are very unstable; the length of the (C7)-
sequences vary from 7 to 10 nucleotides and (C5)-
sequences vary from 5 to 7 nucleotides (Torroni
et al. 1994; Howell & Smejkal, 2001). The longest
polypyrimidine tract, which was identified in
Poles and Russians, was (C10)-T-(C6). In the
present study, however, we have observed a
poly-C tract with a total length of 13 C-residues,
generated by a transition from T to C at np 310.
This (C13)-sequence was observed in different
mitochondrial haplogroups – H, U4, T, C and
M* (see Appendix).

allowed detection of 455 different mitochondrial
haplotypes (see Appendix): 329 haplotypes
among 436 Poles and 158 haplotypes among 201
Russians. This high resolution ensured that only
32 shared HVS I and II haplotypes were found
between Poles and Russians.
In order to determine the phylogenetic status
of HVS I and II sequences, restriction analysis of
the coding regions was performed. As a result, it
was found that mitochondrial haplotypes in
Poles and Russians are clustered, according to
the mtDNA classification (Macaulay et al. 1999;
Richards et al. 2000; Torroni et al. 2001), into
haplogroups H, pre-V, HV*, pre-HV, U, K, J, T,
I, X, N, R*, M, L3 and their subgroups (Table 4).
The Polish and Russian samples studied are
characterized by a similar pattern of mtDNA
haplogroup distributions. Comparison between
them did not reveal statistical differences (χ#¯
23±33, 23 .., p¯ 0±44).
The main mitochondrial haplogroup of the
Polish and Russian sequences is group H, which
is the most frequent haplogroup in Europe and
also common in the Near East (Richards et al.
1998, 2000). Haplogroup H comprises the ma-
jority of the Russian (42±3%) and Polish (45±2%)
samples. This haplogroup has been difficult to
subdivide based on HVS I and II variation
alone. A number of major clades within haplo-
group H were revealed on the basis of high-
resolution mtDNA analysis and complete or
partial mtDNA sequencing (Macaulay et al. 1999;
Torroni et al. 1999; Finnila$ et al. 2001b). Based
on mtDNA HVS I and II sequencing data in
Poles and Russians, only three clearly defined H-
subgroups, which are characterized by HVS I
and II motifs 16362-239, 16293-16311-195 and
16162-73, respectively, were found. A transition,
T!C at np 239, appears to be a relatively stable
marker for H-16362 sequence types, being found
only sparsely on the background of haplogroup I
(Table 2). Variant 73G is a relatively stable
marker for those HVS I types which distinguish
themselves from the CRS by a variant 16162G.
However, HVS I sequence types determined by
motif 16293, 16311 exhibit diagnostic variant
195C in a position that seems to be hypervariable
(Table 2).
The node designated as HV* (Richards et al.
1998, 2000) is highly important in mtDNA
phylogeny because two of the most frequent
haplogroups in Europe, H and pre-V, descend
from it. The haplogroup HV*, rare in European
populations, was identified in Polish and Russian
samples with low frequency (1% and 2%,
respectively). However, these sequences are
heterogeneous and belong to various HV*-
subgroups, determined by variants 16067T,
16311C or 73G. A single sequence type 16126C-
16362C, which was found among Russians, is
a member of cluster pre-HV (Richards et al.
2000).
Haplogroup pre-V sequences, defined by the
CR motif 16298-72 (Torroni et al. 2001), were
present in Poles and Russians at frequencies of
4±8% and 5±5%, respectively. All of these
samples harbored a full CR motif of haplogroup
pre-V, with the exception of three Polish indi-
viduals who do not have a marker at np 72, but
belong nevertheless to the haplogroup pre-V,
being found in association with RFLP variant
Polish and Russian MtDNAs 269
­15904MseI. In addition, the HVS I haplogroup
pre-V sequences lacking 16298C variant were
found in one Polish and one Russian individual.
It may be noted that haplogroup pre-V fre-
quencies in Poles and Russians correspond to
those observed in other Western, Central and
Northern European populations (Table 1 in
Torroni et al. 2001).
Phylogenetic studies have shown that haplo-
groups J and T stem from a common node which
is distinguished from the ancestral node R* by
polymorphisms at nps 4216, 11251, 15452 and
16126 (Macaulay et al. 1999; Finnila$ et al. 2001b).
Both haplogroups are widely distributed in
European populations as well as in the Polish
and Russian samples presented here. Haplogroup
T represents 11±5% of the Polish and 11% of the
Russian mtDNAs, and includes two distinct
subgroups, T* and T1, distributed among Poles
and Russians with equal frequencies. On the
basis of HVS I motifs, subhaplogroup T* may be
further differentiated into several subclusters ;
but their phylogenetic reliability appears to be
ambiguous due to the influence of several
unstable nucleotide positions, such as 16296,
16292 and, possibly, 16304 (Malyarchuk &
Derenko, 1999; Richards et al. 2000; Finnila$ &
Majamaa, 2001).
Haplogroup J sequences in Poles and Russians
are characterized by similar frequencies of 7±8%
and 8%, respectively. Based on HVS I poly-
morphisms, this haplogroup can be divided into
four subgroups, determined by motifs 16069-
16126 (J*), 16069-16126-16145-16222-16261
(J1b), 16069-16126-16145-16231-16261 (J1a),
and 16069-16126-16278 (J2) (Richards et al.
1998). Based on HVS II mutations, haplogroup J
is characterized by marker variant 295T and can
be further divided into subgroups, represented
by additional motifs 185-228 (for J*), 242 (for
J1b), 150-195 (for J1a), and 150 (for J2).
Phylogenetic analysis of the complete mtDNA
sequences revealed a subdivision of the haplo-
group J into two major subclusters. One is
determined by polymorphism at np 3010 and
combines subgroups J* and J1b. The second
subcluster is defined by polymorphisms at nps
7476 and 15257, and consists of J1b and J2
(Finnila$ & Majamaa, 2001). Therefore, com-
parison of the mtDNA coding region with non-
coding region variability data suggests that
parallel mutations at nps 16145, 16172 and
16261 should be assumed to obtain a concordant
network for haplogroup J (Finnila$ & Majamaa,
2001). In addition, np 16222 has undergone two
independent mutations, being found in J1b and
J* Polish sequences (Table 1). Similarly, identical
HVS I sequence types 16069-16126-16311 were
observed in Poles and Russians as belonging to
two different subgroups, J* and J1a, based on
HVS II information. Subgroup J* was found
to be predominant among Poles and Russians
and was present at population frequencies of
4±6% and 5±5%, respectively. The remaining
J-subclusters were found with lower frequencies,
ranging from 0±9% for J1a and J2 and 1±4% for
J1b in Poles, and from 0±5% for J1a and 2%
for J1b in Russians.
Haplogroup U and K sequences, which are
defined by a variant ­12308HinfI, were found in
19±5% of the Polish mtDNAs and in 20±0% of
the Russian mtDNAs. Of these, haplogroup K
sequences are relatively rare both in Poles and in
Russians (3±4% and 3±0%, respectively). On the
contrary, haplogroup U itself is widely distrib-
uted in Slavonic populations and is represented
by subgroups U*, U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U7 and
U8.
U5, the most frequent and ancient subgroup of
haplogroup U in Europe (Torroni et al. 1996;
Richards et al. 1998, 2000), is represented in
Poles and Russians by two main subgroups, U5a
and U5b. On the basis of complete mtDNA
sequence variation in Finns, Finnila$ et al. (2000)
found mutations at np 14793 and at nps 7768
and 14182 were shared, correspondingly, by
subgroups U5a (with HVS I motif 16192-16256-
16270) and U5b (with HVS I motif 16189-16192-
16270). This subdivision of haplogroup U5 is
confirmed by HVS II sequence data, since all of
U5b-sequences which were observed in Poles and
Russians have an additional marker mutation at
np 150 (Appendix). Although HVS II site 150
has undergone multiple mutations on the back-
ground of different mitochondrial lineages (Table
2), it nonetheless seems to be fixed for subgroup

U5b. The distribution of the subgroup U5a and
U5b frequencies in Poles and Russians is approxi-
mately equal, with the U5a subgroup prevailing
over U5b – 5±3% and 3±4% in Poles, and 7±5%
and 3% in Russians.
U4 (with CR motif 16356-195) is the next
relatively frequent subgroup in the populations
studied, being found at a frequency of 5% in
Poles and 3±5% in Russians. Phylogeographic
studies revealed that two major founder clusters
characterize U4, determined by HVS I motifs
16356 and 16134-16356 (Richards et al.1998,
2000) ; it was also suggested that the latter
subgroup appears to be specific for Central and
Eastern European populations. In this study,
16134-16356 sequences with low frequencies of
1±4% in Poles and 0±5% in Russians were
observed. Perhaps more importantly, among
Poles and Russians 14 HVS I sequences which
belong to haplogroup U (­12308HinfI) have
been identified, but they do not share any
mutations with subgroup-specific poly-
morphisms within haplogroup U (Table 5). All of
these sequence types, as well as some members of
subgroup U4, are characterized by HVS II motif
73-310. These samples were tested for the
presence of a U4-diagnostic site ­4643RsaI and
it was found that all of them belong to the U4-
subgroup. In accordance with the style of
established mtDNA nomenclature (Richards et
al. 1998; Macaulay et al. 1999) we designated U4-
sequences with the 310C variant in HVS II as
belonging to clade U4a. Analysis of the published
HVS I and II data allowed us to reveal U4a
sequence types, although at a low frequency, in
populations of Finno-Ugric-speaking Finns and
Nenets, and German-speaking populations of
Austrians and Germans (Table 5). Nevertheless,
the current data on population distribution of
U4a sequences led us to assume that the majority
of them are characteristic for Poles and Russians,
where this U4-subcluster was found with a
frequency of 2±3% and 2±0%, respectively.
The geographic picture of the U4a sequence
distribution remains unclear, since many pub-
lished population data on the HVS I and II
variability appear to be insufficient to determine
an exact phylogenetic status of the CR sequences
(such as CRS-73, for instance) without the
support of coding-region sites. This study has
observed CRS-73 sequences belonging to haplo-
groups H and HV*. Therefore, additional
detailed studies are required to elucidate the
origin and diversification of the U4a subcluster
in Europe. In addition, phylogenetic
relationships between control region sequences
belonging to the U4 subgroup remain ambiguous,
and therefore, the branching order of these
sequence types cannot be resolved (Figure 1).
The median network demonstrates that two
possible phylogenetic directions are possible. The
first scenario suggests that mutation at np 310
appeared later than marker mutation at np
16356, and further diversification of the U4a
occurred after back-mutation at np 16356. On
the contrary, the second scenario suggests that
mutation at np 310 outstripped change at np
16356, and hence, the U4a subcluster may be

Fig. 1. Schematic phylogenetic network of the subhaplogroup U4 sequence types. The node U*, labelled by
an asterisk (*), is defined by the RFLP variant ­12308HinfI and 73G variant in the HVS II, in comparison
with the revised CRS (Andrews et al. 1999). The deletion event at np 315 was not considered. Any diversity
within the node defined by 16356 variant alone is not shown. Reticulation in the network indicates
ambiguity in the topology. RFLP variant is shown with the arrow pointing in the direction of a site gain.
The nodes in the network represent the haplotypes found in populations (Table 5) as well as hypothetical
intermediate haplotypes (empty nodes). Labelled nodes are U4a haplotypes observed in Poles (P), Russians
(R), Germans (G), Austrians (A), Finns (F), Nenets (N), or in West Eurasians (WE).
considered as an ancestral state for the U4-
phylogeny. Unfortunately, with the data on
nucleotide stability in HVS I and II regions, we
were unable to resolve this inconsistency due to
an almost equal instability of nps 16356 and 310
(Tables 1 and 2). According to our data, the
variant 16356C appeared twice and indepen-
dently in the background of haplogroups U and
H, but the variant 310C occurred independently
in the background of haplogroup U, and rarely in
association with H, T*, C, M* lineages. In
addition, diversity estimates calculated for the
two subsets of U4, with and without the 310C
variant, gave similar values of ρ¯ 0±929 for U4a
and ρ¯ 1±083 for the remaining U4-HVS I
sequences found in Poles and Russians.
Besides subgroups U5 and U4, several minor
U-subclusters were found in Polish and Russian
mtDNA pools. Subgroup U1 with HVS I motif
16189-16249 (Macaulay et al. 1999), accompanied
by variant 285T in HVS II, was present at a
frequency of 1±0% in Russians. Subgroup U2
sequences, characterized by HVS I and II motif
16051-16129C-152-217-340, were observed at low
frequencies, both in Poles (0±9%) and in Russians
(1±5%). U3-sequences with CR motif 16343-150
appear to be rare in Poles and Russians, being
found at frequencies of 0±5% and 1±0%, re-
spectively. Similarly, U7 sequences with CR
motif 16309-16318T}C-152 were present in the
populations studied at low frequency (less than
1±0%). The U8-subgroup (Finnila$ et al. 2001b),
which is defined by motif 16342-282, was
observed only in Poles at a frequency of 0±5%.
The remaining haplogroups I, W, X, N1b, N1c
observed in Poles and Russians belong to the
macro-haplogroup N, which also encompasses all
aforementioned clusters of haplogroups (HV, JT,
UK) as members of the macro-haplogroup R
(Macaulay et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2000).
Haplogroup I, characterized by CR motif 16129-
16223-16391-199-204-250, occurred in Poles and
Russians at a frequency of 1±8% and 2±5%,
respectively. N1b and N1c sequences are defined
by tentative HVS I motifs 16145-16176G-16223
and 16223-16265, correspondingly (Richards et
al. 2000), and were found as individual haplo-
types in Poles. Haplogroup W sequences (CR
motif 16223-16292-189-204-207) were observed
in Poles and Russians at frequencies of 3±7% and
2±0%. Topology of the phylogenetic network of
haplogroups I and W was resolved based on
mtDNA variability in the coding region, with the
exception of reticulation composed of poly-
morphisms at nps 1719 and 8251 (Finnila$ et al.
2001b). According to the phylogeny suggested by
272 B. A. M  
Finnila$ et al. (2001b), variant 204C appears to be
ancestral for the IW branch, but various 207A
originated twice as a parallel mutation in
haplogroups W and I. However, population data
on HVS I and II variation presented here
demonstrated that combination of the variants
204C-207A is characteristic for mtDNA
sequences from haplogroups W, I and N1c,
implying that this motif may be considered as
ancestral.
Haplogroup X was found in Poles and
Russians at a frequency of 1±8% and 3±5%,
respectively. This haplogroup, rare in Europe, is
determined by CR motif 16189-16223-16278-
153-195-225 and further subdivided into two
clusters defined by mutations at nps 226 and 227.
Interestingly, both in Poles (0±5%) and in
Russians (1±5%) several sequence types without
HVS II diagnostic mutations at nps 153, 195,
225 were observed. Several rare X-HVS I
sequences defined by variants 16248T and
16266T-16274A were previously revealed in
southern West Eurasian populations (Richards
et al. 2000). In addition, X-HVS I sequences
determined by variant 16241G, rare in Russians
(1%), were described recently among Gypsies at
a frequency of 2±2% (Gresham et al. 2001).
The remaining CR sequences found in Poles
and Russians were classified as belonging to the
East Eurasian macro-haplogroup M. Both
macro-haplogroups M and N coalesce to the
African cluster L3, which is considered as the
most recent ancestor of all Eurasians (Quintana-
Murci et al. 1999; Ingman et al. 2000). M-
haplogroups such as C, D, E, G and Z are very
rare in western European populations. We have
observed members of the haplogroups C, D, E, G
and M* in Poles and Russians at a frequency of
1±8% and 1±5%, respectively. However, diver-
sity of the M-CR sequence types was high, both
in Poles and in Russians. Haplogroup C
sequences defined by CR motif 16223-16298-
16327-249D were present in Poles. Haplogroup C
sequences were previously also described at low
frequency in Russian populations (Orekhov et al.
1999; Malyarchuk et al. 2001). In addition,
haplogroup Z sequences were revealed in
Russians at a frequency of 1±3% (Orekhov et
al. 1999; Malyarchuk & Derenko, 2001).
Interestingly, both haplogroup C and Z
sequences are characterized by the deletion of an
adenine residue at np 249 (variant 249D).
According to the phylogenetic data based on
variation in the complete mtDNA sequences,
both haplogroups C and Z have shared poly-
morphisms at nps 4715, 7196CA, and 8584
(Finnila$ et al. 2001b ; Maca-Meyer et al. 2001) and
should be considered as sister haplogroups
(Kivisild et al. 2001). Haplogroup Z sequences
were found in many Siberian}Central Asian
populations (Kolman et al. 1996; Derenko &
Shields, 1997; Schurr et al. 1999; Derenko et al.
2000) as well as in Saami (Sajantila et al. 1995).
The Saami gene pool is also characterized by the
presence of the D-lineage with motif 16126-
16136-16189-16223-16360-16362, found at a low
frequency of 4±7% (Delghandi et al. 1998). In the
present study, an identical sequence type was
found among Russians. A similar CR sequence
type, observed in Poles, belongs to the 16189-
subcluster of haplogroup D. In addition, both
Polish and Russian samples are characterized by
the presence of the Saami-specific U5b-motif
(16144-16189-16270) found at a frequency of
0±5% in Poles and 1±5% in Russians. The
presence of the Saami-specific mtDNAs from
haplogroups D and U5b, as well as haplogroup Z
sequences, in the mitochondrial gene pool of
Russians was considered as a consequence of
local Finno-Ugric tribe assimilation by Slavs
during their movement to the north of Eastern
Europe, a trend suggested previously by anthro-
pologists (Alekseeva, 1973).
The remaining M-sequences in Poles and
Russians were identified as belonging to haplo-
groups G, E and M*. In the case of haplogroup G,
both Russian and Polish sequence types had
both G and E specific RFLPs (­4830HaeII}
­4831HhaI for G and ®7598HhaI for E); the
latter marker originated on the background of
haplogroup G due to mutation at np 7600,
which gives a similar E-specific RFLP pattern
(Kivisild et al. 2001).
Therefore, the results of mtDNA variation
study demonstrated that all major West
Eurasian haplogroups and their subgroups were
Polish and Russian MtDNAs 273

that the East Asian admixture in Poles and
Russians appears to be insignificant (less than
2±0%).
MtDNA haplotypes and subclusters shared
between Poles and Russians
It has been suggested, by means of phylo-
genetic analysis (Comas et al. 1997; Richards et
al. 1998; Simoni et al. 2000), that European
populations demonstrate limited genetic differ-
entiation and do not exhibit any obvious
geographic patterns. However, the study by
Helgason et al. (2000) indicated that European
populations contain a large number of closely
related mtDNA lineages, many of which have
not yet been sampled in the current comparative
data set. This means that geographic patterns of
mtDNA variation may exist at the level of
individual lineages or lineage subclusters.
In the present study, a high level of mtDNA
diversity in Poles and Russians sharing the same
language group has been found. In order to

investigate genetic similarity between them at
the level of shared mtDNA haplotypes and their
subclusters, the total number of CR sequence
types has been reduced by means of removing
polymorphic variants at unstable sites (such as
A!C transversions at nps 16182 and 16183) and
insertions of additional C residues in the HVS I
and II poly-C tracts. As a result, out of 297 and
142 CR sequence types observed in Poles and
Russians, respectively, 34 are shared between
these population samples. Table 6 shows the
distribution of shared haplotypes between Poles
and Russians in comparison with Germans and
Finns. The latter populations were selected in
accordance with their geographic proximity and
the historical evidence concerning their par-
ticipation in the formation of modern Poles and
Russians. The results of this analysis indicate
that only a small fraction of the CR haplotypes
(10 out of 34 haplotypes) appear to be actually
shared between Poles and Russians, not being
found in German and Finnish gene pools. These
haplotypes belong to five different haplo-
groups – H, HV*, U4, U5, and J*. It should be
noted, however, that the majority of these
haplotypes belong to subclusters which can be
found in common among many West Eurasian
populations.
In order to identify subclusters of CR haplo-
types which are specific mainly for Poles and
Russians, the distribution of haplotypes that
differ by the fewest number of base substitutions
in Poles and Russians and their neighbours,
Germans and Finns, were analyzed. Although
almost all of the mtDNA subclusters observed in
Poles and Russians can be accounted for in many
European populations, this analysis allowed us
to reveal at least 16 subclusters of relatively rare
haplotypes which have a preferential distri-
bution among Poles and Russians (Table 7). In
Russians, H-subclusters determined by HVS I
motifs 16129 (and 16129-16316), 16256 (and
16256-16352, 16256-16319), and 16354 were
found at a relatively high frequency, ranging
from 2±5% to 4±5%. In Poles, sequence types
with motif 16092-16140-16265-16293-16311 oc-
curred at the frequency of 2±8%. Similar haplo-
types, defined by motif 16293-16278-16311, were
also common between Russians and Poles (1±5%
and 0±7%, respectively). However, it is known
that the subcluster of H-haplotypes determined
by motif 16293-16311 has a pan-European
distribution (Richards & Macaulay, 2000). More-
over, the highest frequency (6±1%) of this H-
subcluster was found in Estonians (Tambets et
al. 2000). Another H-subcluster, defined by motif
Polish and Russian MtDNAs 275
16189-16356 and its branches 16080-16189-16356
and 16189-16356-16362, was found frequently in
Poles (3±3%) as well as in Russians (2±5%) and
Germans (1±7%). A relatively high occurrence of
H1-sequences determined by motif 16192-16304-
16311 is characteristic for Russians in com-
parison to Poles and Germans, but another H1-
branch (with motif 16294-16304) is clearly com-
mon between Germans and Poles.
Taking into account the data presented in
Tables 6 and 7, one can conclude that we were
not able to find any specific combinations of
unique mtDNA haplotypes and their subclusters
clearly distinguishing Poles and Russians, as
Slavonic-speaking populations, from the neigh-
boring European populations such as Germans
and Finns. This trend was also noted in a
previous study on the HVS I-RFLP variation in
Russians in comparison with Western and East-
ern European populations (Malyarchuk &
Derenko, 2001). One possible exception is sub-
group U4a. This subgroup comprises 10 (2±3%)
out of 436 Poles, 4 (2±0%) out of 201 Russians, 2
(0±4%) out of 560 Germans (Parson et al. 1998;
Baasner & Madea, 2000) and 1 (0±25%) out of
403 Finns (Finnila$ et al. 2001a). Given the
relatively high frequency and diversity of U4a
among Poles and Russians and its low frequency
in the neighbouring German and Finnish popu-
lations, one can suggest a central-eastern
European origin of U4a. It is possible that the
subsequent dispersal of this mtDNA subgroup in
Eastern European populations was due to
Slavonic migrations. Undoubtedly, to elucidate
the origin of the U4a subgroup, additional
analysis is required followed by a much more
extensive sampling of Slavonic and other
European populations.

Analysis of mtDNA variation, performed by
means of sequencing two hypervariable segments
and assaying of haplogroup-diagnostic poly-
morphisms in the coding region, appears to be an
effective genetic tool for inferring the genetic
history of populations (Macaulay et al. 1999). In
the present study, we have found that Poles and
Russians are characterized by the same West
Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups which describe at
least 95% of mtDNA variations in Europe and
the Near East (Torroni et al. 1996; Richards et al.
1998, 2000). Although there is a good corre-
spondence between CR sequences and RFLPs
grouping into monophyletic mtDNA clusters,
and this looks to be strongest when only HVS I
sequences are used in comparison (Bandelt et al.
2000) ; the addition of the HVS II sequences may
be extremely useful in the resolution of the
phylogenetic relationships among some uncer-
tain mitochondrial lineages. A good example of
this is subgroup U4a which does not have a
certain HVS I motif, but can be recognized on
the basis of HVS II information.
Despite the high level of mtDNA variation in
Poles and Russians, both populations exhibit a
similar pattern of mtDNA haplogroup distri-
bution, which is also typical for many European
populations studied. Moreover, the analysis of
distribution of CR haplotypes and subclusters
shared between Poles and Russians has shown
that both Slavonic populations share them
mainly with Germans and Finns. These data
allow us to suggest that Europeans, despite their
linguistic differences, originated in the common
genetic substratum which predates the formation
of the most modern European populations. It
seems that considerable genetic similarity be-
tween European populations, which has been
revealed by mtDNA variation studies, was
further accelerated by a process of gene re-
distribution between populations due to the
multiple migrations occurring in Europe during
the past millenia (Sykes, 1999; Helgason et al.
2000; Richards et al. 2000). As for Slavonic-
speaking populations, the evidence from the
present study and our previous work
(Malyarchuk & Derenko, 2001) suggests that the
assumption of a common central European origin
of Slavs should be tested with additional studies
of mtDNA and Y chromosome variability in
Slavonic populations inhabiting different regions
of Europe.

Sample codes: POL, Poles ; RUS, Russians. Mutations are shown indicating positions relative to the CRS
(Anderson et al. 1981). The nucleotide positions in HVS I and II sequences correspond to transitions; transversions
are further specified. Haplogroup names (HG) are given in capital letters according to the mtDNA classification
(Macaulay et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2000). The presence of insertions or deletions is referred by .1, .2 and .3 or D,
respectively, following the nucleotide position.
We are very grateful to Ewa Lewandowska for her
excellent technical assistance. The authors would like to
thank two anonymous reviewers for the useful comments.
